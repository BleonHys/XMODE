In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions).\"}",

This is a moment of divine grace and the promise of salvation, a core theme of joy in Christian theology.\n*   The presence of the angel, a divine messenger, and the star symbolizing the miraculous nature of the event contribute to a sense of awe and divine favor.\n\n**Elements showing sorrow:**\n*   The leftmost panel shows a scene with a bishop and several figures, one of whom appears to be holding a child. The somber expressions and the dark, heavy drapery suggest a moment of mourning or a funeral, which is a clear depiction of sorrow.\n*   The rightmost panel depicts a monk in a dark robe, sitting in a contemplative or penitent pose before an altar. His posture and the austere setting evoke a sense of spiritual sorrow, introspection, or grief, common in depictions of monastic life or repentance.\n\nThe painting's composition,"

Her rich, luxurious red garment with its soft folds and the glimpse of a white undergarment suggest status and grace, often associated with happiness and prosperity. The presence of a small dog at her side (partially visible) can symbolize companionship and affection, which are sources of joy.\n\nElements showing sorrow: The dark, shadowy background creates a somber, isolating atmosphere. The sword she holds \u2014 a symbol of conflict, danger, or impending violence \u2014 introduces a sense of melancholy or impending loss. Her slightly melancholic expression, with a hint of weariness or resolve, suggests inner turmoil or the burden of her role or situation.\n\nTogether, these elements create a complex portrait that balances the warmth of her status and companionship with the weight of her weapon and the somber setting, evoking both joy and sorrow."

Her posture is upright and dignified, and she holds a small dog (a symbol of companionship and affection) close to her side, which can suggest warmth and tenderness. The rich, warm reds of her clothing and the soft, luminous quality of the light on her skin and fabric also contribute to a sense of beauty and grace, often associated with joy or contentment.\n\nElements showing sorrow: The dark, shadowy background isolates the figure, creating a somber mood. She holds a sword \u2014 a weapon \u2014 which is a powerful symbol of conflict, danger, or impending loss. Her expression, while calm, is not overtly smiling; it carries a quiet intensity that could imply inner turmoil or the weight of responsibility. The overall composition, with its dramatic chiaroscuro (contrast of light and dark), evokes a sense of gravity and seriousness, hinting at sorrow or melancholy.\n\nThus, the painting juxtaposes symbols of peace and companionship (the dog, her gentle demeanor) with symbols of conflict and solemnity (the sword, the dark background), creating a complex emotional duality \u2014 both joy and sorrow."

Her posture is solemn, and her gaze is directed away from the viewer, suggesting introspection or melancholy. The black color of her clothing is a powerful symbol of grief or spiritual devotion.\n\n*   **Joy:** Despite the somber figure, the scene is filled with elements of celebration and opulence. The background features a grand, ornate architectural setting with gold accents and a clock tower. People are gathered on balconies, seemingly engaged in social activity. The elaborate heraldic shield at the base of the painting, with its vibrant red and gold colors and crowned figures, signifies nobility, status, and wealth\u2014all traditionally associated with joy and celebration. The gold decorations throughout the scene further contribute to an atmosphere of festivity and grandeur.\n\nTherefore, the painting juxtaposes the sorrowful figure of the nun with the joyful, celebratory setting around her, creating a complex emotional narrative."

Her posture and the dark, heavy robes contribute to a solemn mood.\n- The overall monochromatic palette and the dark, muted background enhance the sense of melancholy and reverence.\n\nElements showing joy:\n- The figure on the right (likely Saint John the Baptist) holds a lamb, which is a symbol of innocence, purity, and Christ\u2019s sacrifice \u2014 often interpreted as a joyful or redemptive symbol within Christian iconography.\n- The halos around both figures signify their holy status and divine connection, which carries inherent joy and spiritual fulfillment.\n- The gentle gesture of Saint John pointing toward the lamb suggests a moment of revelation or blessing \u2014 a joyful act of spiritual guidance.\n\nThus, the painting balances sorrow (in Mary\u2019s expression and the somber tone) with joy (in the holy symbols and divine presence), reflecting the complex emotional landscape of Christian theology \u2014 particularly the sorrow of Christ\u2019s impending sacrifice and the joy of salvation."

He is portrayed as extremely emaciated, with a gaunt, thin frame, sunken cheeks, and a weary, pained expression. His physical state reflects the suffering and asceticism of his life as a hermit and scholar. His bare feet and simple, tattered garments further emphasize his humble and penitent condition. The overall somber color palette \u2014 dominated by muted earth tones, browns, and a desaturated sky \u2014 contributes to a melancholic mood.\n\n**Joy:**\nDespite the evident suffering, the painting also conveys a sense of joy, primarily through the symbolic attributes and the spiritual context. Saint Jerome holds a wheel with a cross (a symbol of his martyrdom and the triumph of faith over suffering). His gaze is directed upward, suggesting spiritual contemplation and connection with the divine. The vibrant red and green drapery he wears \u2014 rich, saturated colors \u2014 contrast with his physical frailty and symbolize the vitality of faith and the divine"

The overall mood is one of gravitas, not emotional distress.\n\nIn Renaissance portraiture, especially of high-ranking church officials, emotional restraint was the norm.

The man on the left, likely Plato, is shown in deep mourning, his head bowed and hand covering his face.\n- The chained feet of the young man in red (likely Crito or a servant) symbolize the inescapable nature of death and the gravity of the situation.\n- The somber, dark tones of the background and the restrained color palette contribute to the melancholy atmosphere.\n\n**Elements showing joy:**\n- Socrates himself is portrayed with a calm, almost serene expression, his eyes open and his hand raised in a gesture of philosophical triumph or farewell. His posture and demeanor suggest acceptance and inner peace.\n- His raised finger points upward, a traditional symbol of divine inspiration or the presence of the gods \u2014 suggesting spiritual joy or transcendence"

The woman to the right, draped in a dark cloth and seated, appears to be in mourning.\n- The dark, somber tones and the overall mood of the scene emphasize the tragedy of the moment.\n\n**Elements showing joy:**\n- The painting also conveys a sense of spiritual and intellectual joy. Socrates\u2019 serene expression and the way he accepts his fate suggest a joy in his principles and the truth he has upheld.\n- The presence of the philosopher\u2019s disciples, including the young man in the background who is reading, symbolizes the joy of knowledge and the continuation of his legacy.\n- The bright, warm light illuminating"

Her white gown is clean and flowing, symbolizing purity and grace. The ornate, well-crafted chaise longue and the decorative candlestick indicate wealth and refinement, which are often associated with happiness and comfort. Her posture is relaxed and composed, and her direct gaze can convey confidence and serenity.\n\n*   **Sorrow:** The elements suggesting sorrow are primarily the somber mood created by the dark, plain background and the woman\u2019s expression. Her face is turned slightly away, and her expression is neutral or pensive, lacking overt happiness. The stark, almost oppressive darkness surrounding her creates a sense of isolation or melancholy. The overall composition feels restrained and introspective, hinting at inner contemplation or sadness.\n\nThis duality\u2014of elegance and isolation, of comfort and melancholy\u2014is characteristic of Neoclassical portraiture, where the subject's inner state is often subtly conveyed through composition and mood rather than overt emotion."

Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

This is a moment of divine grace and the promise of salvation, a core theme of joy in Christian theology.\n*   The presence of the angel, a divine messenger, and the star symbolizing the miraculous nature of the event contribute to a sense of awe and divine favor.\n\n**Elements showing sorrow:**\n*   The leftmost panel shows a scene with a bishop and several figures, one of whom appears to be holding a child. The somber expressions and the dark, heavy drapery suggest a moment of mourning or a funeral, which is a clear depiction of sorrow.\n*   The rightmost panel depicts a monk in a dark robe, sitting in a contemplative or penitent pose before an altar. His posture and the austere setting evoke a sense of spiritual sorrow, introspection, or grief, common in depictions of monastic life or repentance.\n\nThe painting's composition,"

Her rich, luxurious red garment with its soft folds and the glimpse of a white undergarment suggest status and grace, often associated with happiness and prosperity. The presence of a small dog at her side (partially visible) can symbolize companionship and affection, which are sources of joy.\n\nElements showing sorrow: The dark, shadowy background creates a somber, isolating atmosphere. The sword she holds \u2014 a symbol of conflict, danger, or impending violence \u2014 introduces a sense of melancholy or impending loss. Her slightly melancholic expression, with a hint of weariness or resolve, suggests inner turmoil or the burden of her role or situation.\n\nTogether, these elements create a complex portrait that balances the warmth of her status and companionship with the weight of her weapon and the somber setting, evoking both joy and sorrow."

Answer with yes or no, and explain which elements show joy and which show sorrow.": "Yes.\n\nElements showing joy: The woman\u2019s expression is calm and composed, with a gentle, almost serene gaze. Her posture is upright and dignified, and she holds a small dog (a symbol of companionship and affection) close to her side, which can suggest warmth and tenderness. The rich, warm reds of her clothing and the soft, luminous quality of the light on her skin and fabric also contribute to a sense of beauty and grace, often associated with joy or contentment.\n\nElements showing sorrow: The dark, shadowy background isolates the figure, creating a somber mood. She holds a sword \u2014 a weapon \u2014 which is a powerful symbol of conflict, danger, or impending loss. Her expression, while calm, is not overtly smiling; it carries a quiet intensity that could imply inner turmoil or the weight of responsibility. The overall composition, with its dramatic chiaroscuro (contrast of light and dark), evokes a sense of gravity and seriousness, hinting at sorrow or melancholy.\n\nThus, the painting juxtaposes symbols of peace and companionship (the dog, her gentle demeanor) with symbols of conflict and solemnity (the sword, the dark background), creating a complex emotional duality \u2014 both joy and sorrow."

He is portrayed as extremely emaciated, with a gaunt, thin frame, sunken cheeks, and a weary, pained expression.

Her white gown is clean and flowing, symbolizing purity and grace. The ornate, well-crafted chaise longue and the decorative candlestick indicate wealth and refinement, which are often associated with happiness and comfort. Her posture is relaxed and composed, and her direct gaze can convey confidence and serenity.\n\n*   **Sorrow:** The elements suggesting sorrow are primarily the somber mood created by the dark, plain background and the woman\u2019s expression. Her face is turned slightly away, and her expression is neutral or pensive, lacking overt happiness. The stark, almost oppressive darkness surrounding her creates a sense of isolation or melancholy. The overall composition feels restrained and introspective, hinting at inner contemplation or sadness.\n\nThis duality\u2014of elegance and isolation, of comfort and melancholy\u2014is characteristic of Neoclassical portraiture, where the subject's inner state is often subtly conveyed through composition and mood rather than overt emotion."

This is a moment of divine grace and the promise of salvation, a core theme of joy in Christian theology.\n*   The presence of the angel, a divine messenger, and the star symbolizing the miraculous nature of the event contribute to a sense of awe and divine favor.\n\n**Elements showing sorrow:**\n*   The leftmost panel shows a scene with a bishop and several figures, one of whom appears to be holding a child. The somber expressions and the dark, heavy drapery suggest a moment of mourning or a funeral, which is a clear depiction of sorrow.\n*   The rightmost panel depicts a monk in a dark robe, sitting in a contemplative or penitent pose before an altar. His posture and the austere setting evoke a sense of spiritual sorrow, introspection, or grief, common in depictions of monastic life or repentance.\n\nThe painting's composition,"

Answer with yes or no, and explain which elements show joy and which show sorrow.": "Yes.\n\nElements showing joy: The woman\u2019s calm, direct gaze and composed expression convey a sense of dignity and inner strength. Her rich, luxurious red garment with its soft folds and the glimpse of a white undergarment suggest status and grace, often associated with happiness and prosperity. The presence of a small dog at her side (partially visible) can symbolize companionship and affection, which are sources of joy.\n\nElements showing sorrow: The dark, shadowy background creates a somber, isolating atmosphere. The sword she holds \u2014 a symbol of conflict, danger, or impending violence \u2014 introduces a sense of melancholy or impending loss. Her slightly melancholic expression, with a hint of weariness or resolve, suggests inner turmoil or the burden of her role or situation.\n\nTogether, these elements create a complex portrait that balances the warmth of her status and companionship with the weight of her weapon and the somber setting, evoking both joy and sorrow."

Answer with yes or no, and explain which elements show joy and which show sorrow.": "Yes.\n\nElements showing joy: The woman\u2019s expression is calm and composed, with a gentle, almost serene gaze. Her posture is upright and dignified, and she holds a small dog (a symbol of companionship and affection) close to her side, which can suggest warmth and tenderness. The rich, warm reds of her clothing and the soft, luminous quality of the light on her skin and fabric also contribute to a sense of beauty and grace, often associated with joy or contentment.\n\nElements showing sorrow: The dark, shadowy background isolates the figure, creating a somber mood. She holds a sword \u2014 a weapon \u2014 which is a powerful symbol of conflict, danger, or impending loss. Her expression, while calm, is not overtly smiling; it carries a quiet intensity that could imply inner turmoil or the weight of responsibility. The overall composition, with its dramatic chiaroscuro (contrast of light and dark), evokes a sense of gravity and seriousness, hinting at sorrow or melancholy.\n\nThus, the painting juxtaposes symbols of peace and companionship (the dog, her gentle demeanor) with symbols of conflict and solemnity (the sword, the dark background), creating a complex emotional duality \u2014 both joy and sorrow."

Her posture is solemn, and her gaze is directed away from the viewer, suggesting introspection or melancholy. The black color of her clothing is a powerful symbol of grief or spiritual devotion.\n\n*   **Joy:** Despite the somber figure, the scene is filled with elements of celebration and opulence. The background features a grand, ornate architectural setting with gold accents and a clock tower. People are gathered on balconies, seemingly engaged in social activity. The elaborate heraldic shield at the base of the painting, with its vibrant red and gold colors and crowned figures, signifies nobility, status, and wealth\u2014all traditionally associated with joy and celebration. The gold decorations throughout the scene further contribute to an atmosphere of festivity and grandeur.\n\nTherefore, the painting juxtaposes the sorrowful figure of the nun with the joyful, celebratory setting around her, creating a complex emotional narrative."

This is evident in:\n    -   The central figure, Saint Sebastian, who is being tortured and killed. His body is shown in agony, and his expression conveys suffering.\n    -   The presence of soldiers with spears and swords, actively carrying out the execution.\n    -   The fallen, naked figure at the bottom, likely a victim of the same persecution or a symbol of the suffering of the faithful.\n    -   The overall dark, somber palette and the violent, chaotic scene.\n\n*   **Joy:** The joy is more subtle and symbolic, tied to the martyr's faith and the promise of salvation:\n    -   The halo around Saint Sebastian's head signifies his holiness and divine favor, which can be interpreted as a form of spiritual joy or triumph over death.\n    -   The bright, golden light emanating from behind him and the moon in the sky suggest divine presence and hope, contrasting with the darkness of the earthly suffering.\n    -   The act of martyrdom itself, while painful, is often depicted in Christian"

Her posture and the dark, heavy robes contribute to a solemn mood.\n- The overall monochromatic palette and the dark, muted background enhance the sense of melancholy and reverence.\n\nElements showing joy:\n- The figure on the right (likely Saint John the Baptist) holds a lamb, which is a symbol of innocence, purity, and Christ\u2019s sacrifice \u2014 often interpreted as a joyful or redemptive symbol within Christian iconography.\n- The halos around both figures signify their holy status and divine connection, which carries inherent joy and spiritual fulfillment.\n- The gentle gesture of Saint John pointing toward the lamb suggests a moment of revelation or blessing \u2014 a joyful act of spiritual guidance.\n\nThus, the painting balances sorrow (in Mary\u2019s expression and the somber tone) with joy (in the holy symbols and divine presence), reflecting the complex emotional landscape of Christian theology \u2014 particularly the sorrow of Christ\u2019s impending sacrifice and the joy of salvation."

Answer with yes or no, and explain which elements show joy and which show sorrow.": "Yes.\n\nThis painting depicts both joy and sorrow, reflecting the complex, often paradoxical nature of the Madonna and Child theme in Christian art.\n\nElements showing joy:\n- The infant Christ is depicted as playful and lively, with curly red hair and an upward gaze, suggesting innocence and divine vitality.\n- His open, active hands and relaxed posture convey a sense of contentment and divine grace.\n- The warm, reddish tones of the Madonna\u2019s robe and the soft, naturalistic rendering of the child\u2019s skin contribute to a feeling of tenderness and warmth.\n\nElements showing sorrow:\n- The Madonna\u2019s expression is deeply contemplative and serene, with her eyes gently closed and her lips slightly parted \u2014 a common artistic convention to convey her inner spiritual devotion and the weight of her role as the mother of God.\n- Her posture and the way she holds the Christ child suggest a protective, almost reverent solemnity, hinting at the profound sacrifice and future suffering she knows her son will endure.\n- The dark, muted background and the heavy drapery around her create a somber, introspective atmosphere that underscores the sacred gravity of the moment.\n\nTogether, these elements portray the dual nature of the Madonna\u2019s experience: the joy of motherhood and divine love, intertwined with the sorrow of"

He is portrayed as extremely emaciated, with a gaunt, thin frame, sunken cheeks, and a weary, pained expression. His physical state reflects the suffering and asceticism of his life as a hermit and scholar. His bare feet and simple, tattered garments further emphasize his humble and penitent condition. The overall somber color palette \u2014 dominated by muted earth tones, browns, and a desaturated sky \u2014 contributes to a melancholic mood.\n\n**Joy:**\nDespite the evident suffering, the painting also conveys a sense of joy, primarily through the symbolic attributes and the spiritual context. Saint Jerome holds a wheel with a cross (a symbol of his martyrdom and the triumph of faith over suffering). His gaze is directed upward, suggesting spiritual contemplation and connection with the divine. The vibrant red and green drapery he wears \u2014 rich, saturated colors \u2014 contrast with his physical frailty and symbolize the vitality of faith and the divine"

Her white gown is clean and flowing, symbolizing purity and grace. The ornate, well-crafted chaise longue and the decorative candlestick indicate wealth and refinement, which are often associated with happiness and comfort. Her posture is relaxed and composed, and her direct gaze can convey confidence and serenity.\n\n*   **Sorrow:** The elements suggesting sorrow are primarily the somber mood created by the dark, plain background and the woman\u2019s expression. Her face is turned slightly away, and her expression is neutral or pensive, lacking overt happiness. The stark, almost oppressive darkness surrounding her creates a sense of isolation or melancholy. The overall composition feels restrained and introspective, hinting at inner contemplation or sadness.\n\nThis duality\u2014of elegance and isolation, of comfort and melancholy\u2014is characteristic of Neoclassical portraiture, where the subject's inner state is often subtly conveyed through composition and mood rather than overt emotion."

Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions).\"}",

In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions)."

In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions).\"}",

                        "extra explanation": "The paintings that depict both joy and sorrow tend to fall into several categories: religious works (especially Madonna and Child, Crucifixion, and saint martyrdom scenes), historical/mythological narratives, and portraits. In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions)."

He is portrayed as extremely emaciated, with a gaunt, thin frame, sunken cheeks, and a weary, pained expression.

In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions)."

In religious paintings, joy is typically shown through divine elements like halos, golden backgrounds, celestial figures, and symbols of salvation, while sorrow appears in expressions of grief, suffering, martyrdom symbols, and dark atmospheres. In historical and mythological works, joy manifests in triumph, celebration, and love, while sorrow is depicted through death, mourning figures, and conflict. Portraits often show joy through luxurious settings and attire, contrasted with melancholic or introspective expressions. Some paintings had empty responses or were identified as not depicting both emotions, such as 'Die durch Engel bekr\u00f6nte Muttergottes mit Kind im Kreise der 14 Schutzheiligen des Hauses Zimmern', 'Christ of the Mercy', 'Calavera', 'The Death of Marat' (both versions), 'Altarpiece of Santo Domingo de Silos' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Julius III' (both versions), 'Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII, bust-length', 'Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife', and 'The Turkish Bath' (both versions)."

The somber expressions and the dark, heavy drapery suggest a moment of mourning or a funeral, which is a clear depiction of sorrow.\\n*   The rightmost panel depicts a monk in a dark robe, sitting in a contemplative or penitent pose before an altar.
