This image shows a meticulously detailed human skull rendered with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, accompanied by a Latin inscription that reads 'IN OMNIBVS OPERIBVS TVIS MEMORARE E NOVISSI MA TVA ETINA\u00c6 ERNVM NON PECCABIS' (In all your works, remember you will die, and you will not sin). The skull is the most direct, potent, and universally recognized symbol of mortality - it is the literal remnant of the human body after death, stripped of all flesh, muscle, and identity. Other notable Memento Mori images include: Image 4 (1536 portrait of Gottfried Werner von Wildenstein showing a nobleman kneeling in armor with a rosary, juxtaposing worldly power with spiritual humility), Image 18 (Crucifixion of Christ showing the ultimate mortality), Image 38 (a funeral scene depicting burial), and Image 43 (Saint Martin holding an hourglass symbolizing the passage of time).\", 'source': 'Image analysis results from a comprehensive review of 101 images, with detailed art historical analysis of Memento Mori symbolism and iconography', 'inference': 'Image 55', 'extra explanation': \"The concept of 'Memento Mori' (Latin for 'remember you must die') is a philosophical and artistic tradition that serves as a reminder of human mortality and the impermanence of earthly life. Traditional Memento Mori imagery includes skulls, hourglasses, wilting flowers, decaying bodies, skeletons, and other symbols of death and decay. While several images in the collection contain elements related to death and mortality (religious scenes of crucifixion, funeral scenes, portraits with symbolic objects), Image 55 stands out because it combines the most direct symbol (a human skull) with an explicit textual reference to the Memento Mori concept through its Latin inscription.

The woman appears contemplative, perhaps pensive or melancholic, but she is alive, healthy, and surrounded by no explicit indicators of death or decay. The mood is introspective, perhaps even romantic or poetic, but not morbid or vanitas-oriented.\\n\\nWhile one could *interpret* her downward gaze or the somber tones as suggesting a meditation on life\u2019s fragility, such an interpretation is subjective and not grounded in the visual iconography associated with \u201cMemento Mori.\u201d The painting lacks the direct, symbolic language that defines the genre.\\n\\n**'}, {'image_id': '97', 'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg', \"Which image is most representative of the saying 'Memento Mori' (remember you must die)?

One figure in a red robe appears to be lifting or arranging the shroud. The mood is somber, and the focus is on the body being prepared for burial.\n- **Memento Mori Connection**: This scene directly depicts death and the process of burial \u2014 a clear and visceral reminder of mortality. The presence of mourners and the shroud are classic symbols of death and the end of earthly life. It is a powerful, immediate representation of the inevitability of death.\n\n---\n\n### **Scene"

The image you provided \u2014 a portrait of a woman in a red dress holding a sword, with a small dog at her feet \u2014 is **not** a depiction of \u201cMemento Mori.\u201d It is, in fact, a well-known painting titled **\u201cThe Lady with the Sword\u201d** (or \u201cLa Donna con la Spada\u201d) by the Italian Renaissance artist **Titian**, circa 1515\u20131520.\n\n### Analysis of the Image\n\nThis painting is a **portrait of a noblewoman**, likely a member of the Venetian aristocracy.

Please provide the images, and I will be happy to analyze them for you.\n\nIf you meant to include specific images (perhaps from a set you had in mind), please upload them or describe them in detail so I can give you a thorough analysis."

While it has a religious and contemplative tone, it does not explicitly depict death or the afterlife. The focus is on spiritual figures rather than the inevitability of death.\n\n2.  **Top Right Panel (Two Figures in Robes):** This image shows two robed figures, possibly saints or clergy, standing and interacting. The setting is formal and the figures appear engaged in a discussion or ritual. There is no clear indication of mortality or the afterlife, making it less relevant to the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d theme.\n\n3.  **Bottom Left Panel (Crowd with a Figure in a Procession):** This scene depicts a crowd of people, some in elaborate attire, gathered around a central figure who appears to be being honored"

Death is not abstract or distant; it is a concrete, immediate event being witnessed by the living. The presence of the grave-digging shovel, the open grave, and the bodies being lowered into the earth are visceral reminders of mortality.\n\n2.  **Theological and Spiritual Context:** The scene is not merely a funeral; it is a divine intervention. The Virgin Mary and saints appear from heaven, and the deceased is being taken to heaven, not to the underworld. This juxtaposition forces the viewer to confront the reality of death while simultaneously presenting the hope of salvation. This duality is central to the Memento Mori message: death is inevitable, but what comes after is"

The visible blood dripping from his brow is a visceral reminder of the physical reality of death and sacrifice.\n\n2.  **The Halo as a Symbol of Transience**: While halos typically signify divinity or sanctity, in this context, the golden rays emanating from Christ\u2019s head are not merely a sign of holiness but also a visual representation of the divine light that shines through suffering and death. This light can be interpreted as the \u201ctransience\u201d of earthly life \u2014 the fleeting, beautiful, and ultimately mortal nature of existence, which is illuminated by the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n3.  **The \u201cMemento Mori\u201d Motif**: The image is a classic example of Christian"

The angel is standing over a prone figure, who appears to be in a state of despair or death. The presence of the skull on the staff is a direct and unambiguous symbol of mortality. The angel\u2019s posture and the ribbon suggest a solemn, perhaps even grim, announcement of death. The overall composition evokes a sense of inevitability and finality \u2014 the moment of death is being delivered, a stark reminder that death is an inescapable reality.\n\n### Image 2: The Virgin Mary\nThis image shows the Virgin Mary in a posture of prayer or contemplation. While this image may evoke themes of piety, suffering, or divine grace, it does not directly address the concept of mortality. Mary\u2019s role is that of a spiritual figure, often associated with resurrection, salvation, and the divine, rather than the reminder of death.

The Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII (by Titian, c. 1580s):**\n\nThis painting is a masterful example of \u201cMemento Mori\u201d art. While it appears to be a formal, dignified portrait, it is subtly infused with the theme of mortality.\n\n*   **The Subject\u2019s Age and Demeanor:** Pope Gregory XIII is depicted as an elderly man with a long, grey beard and a weary, deeply lined face. His expression is not one of youthful vigor but of profound weariness and contemplation. He looks directly at the viewer with an almost piercing gaze, as if reminding us of the passage of time and the inevitability of death.\n*   **The Handkerchief:** The most significant symbolic element is the white handkerchief held in his left hand. In Renaissance art, a handkerchief, especially one held to the mouth or held in the hand, was a common symbol of death or impending death.

The scene is not one of violent struggle, but of serene, dignified acceptance. Socrates, standing calmly in a red robe, raises his arms to receive the cup, his face composed and his gaze directed upward, as if in contemplation or communion with the divine. His disciples and fellow citizens are gathered around him \u2014 some in anguish, others in quiet reverence \u2014 but none are depicted in a state of panic or denial. The painting captures the moment of transition from life to death with profound gravity.\n\n### Why This Image Best Represents \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1.  **Direct Engagement with Mortality**: The central action is the act of death itself \u2014 the administration of poison. Socrates is not merely *thinking* about death; he is *experiencing* it. The painting forces the viewer to confront the reality of death, not as a distant abstraction, but as an immediate, personal, and unavoidable event.\n\n2"

The scene is charged with profound emotional and philosophical weight, and it serves as a powerful visual embodiment of the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d concept.\n\n#### Key Elements that Represent \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1.  **The Central Act of Death**: Socrates is not depicted in agony or despair. Instead, he is calmly accepting his fate, holding the cup of poison with a serene, almost stoic expression. His posture and demeanor emphasize the acceptance of death as a natural, inevitable part of life \u2014 a direct meditation on mortality.\n\n2.  **The Contrast with the World**: On the left, his students and followers are shown in a state of emotional turmoil \u2014 some are reaching out in desperation, others are holding weapons (like the spear), symbolizing their futile attempts to save him. This contrast highlights the futility of trying to escape death and underscores the finality of the moment"

The scene is set in a richly decorated, opulent chamber, likely in the palace of his general Perdiccas, where Alexander lies dying on a bed. His body is partially covered by a red and blue cloth, and his head rests on a pillow, while his hand is being held by a grieving companion.

The purpose is to encourage reflection on one\u2019s mortality and the impermanence of earthly existence.\n\nThe image you\u2019ve provided \u2014 a portrait of a young woman in profile, rendered in a soft, painterly style (likely by Francisco Goya, based on the signature and brushwork) \u2014 does not contain any of these traditional symbols. The woman appears contemplative, perhaps pensive or melancholic, but she is alive, healthy, and surrounded by no explicit indicators of death or decay. The mood is introspective, perhaps even romantic or poetic, but not morbid or vanitas-oriented.\n\nWhile one could *interpret* her downward gaze or the somber tones as suggesting a meditation on life\u2019s fragility, such an interpretation is subjective and not grounded in the visual iconography associated with \u201cMemento Mori.\u201d The painting lacks the direct, symbolic language that defines the genre.\n\n**"

The Central Theme: The Inevitability of Death**\n\n*   **Socrates\u2019 Calm Acceptance:** The painting depicts the philosopher Socrates calmly drinking the hemlock, the poison that will kill him. His serene expression and composed posture are not signs of fear, but of stoic acceptance of his fate. This is the ultimate act of confronting death head-on \u2014 not with panic, but with dignity. The \u201cMemento Mori\u201d message is not about the horror of death, but about its inevitability and the need to prepare for it with wisdom and virtue.\n\n*   **The Absence of Spectacle:** Unlike many depictions of death that show violence or horror, David presents death as a quiet, rational, and dignified event. This underscores the philosophical idea that death is a natural and unavoidable part of life \u2014 something to be met with calmness, not chaos.\n\n---\n\n**2. The Contrast Between Life"

The dark, somber background strips away any sense of vitality or life, focusing the viewer\u2019s attention on the subject\u2019s fragility.\n  \n- **The Candlestick**: To the left stands a tall candlestick with a small bowl or lamp on top. This is not merely decorative; it is a classic symbol of the \u201cflickering light of life.\u201d The candle\u2019s flame represents life\u2019s brief, fragile duration \u2014 it will inevitably go out.

For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`.

The presence of the dog, a companion animal, adds to the theme of domesticity and affection, not decay or the inevitability of death.\n\nThe painting\u2019s tone is **life-affirming**, even celebratory, despite the dark background.

His posture \u2014 kneeling \u2014 is one of humility and submission, not triumph. He is not celebrating his earthly power but acknowledging his mortality.\n\n- **The Armor and the Sword**: He holds a sword, a symbol of his martial prowess and status. However, the sword is **sheathed**, and his hand is not on the hilt in a gesture of readiness or command. Instead, he holds a **rosary** \u2014 a symbol of faith and spiritual preparedness for death.

In art, it is typically represented through:\n\n- **Symbols of death**: skulls, skeletons, hourglasses, decaying flesh.\n- **Juxtaposition of life and death**: vibrant youth next to decay, or the living confronted by death.\n- **Religious context**: often tied to Christian eschatology \u2014 judgment, heaven, hell, and salvation.\n- **Moral instruction**: reminding the powerful and wealthy that death is the great equalizer.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of the Image**\n\nThis painting \u2014 likely from the late Gothic or early Renaissance period (c. 15th\u201316th century) \u2014 depicts a **funeral scene**, possibly the burial of a nobleman or bishop, with a powerful symbolic message.\n\n#### **Key Elements and Their Symbolic Meaning"

Death is not abstract or distant; it is a concrete, immediate event being witnessed by the living. The presence of the grave-digging shovel, the open grave, and the bodies being lowered into the earth are visceral reminders of mortality.\n\n2.  **Theological and Spiritual Context:** The scene is not merely a funeral; it is a divine intervention. The Virgin Mary and saints appear from heaven, and the deceased is being taken to heaven, not to the underworld. This juxtaposition forces the viewer to confront the reality of death while simultaneously presenting the hope of salvation. This duality is central to the Memento Mori message: death is inevitable, but what comes after is"

The Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII (by Titian, c. 1580s):**\n\nThis painting is a masterful example of \u201cMemento Mori\u201d art. While it appears to be a formal, dignified portrait, it is subtly infused with the theme of mortality.\n\n*   **The Subject\u2019s Age and Demeanor:** Pope Gregory XIII is depicted as an elderly man with a long, grey beard and a weary, deeply lined face. His expression is not one of youthful vigor but of profound weariness and contemplation. He looks directly at the viewer with an almost piercing gaze, as if reminding us of the passage of time and the inevitability of death.\n*   **The Handkerchief:** The most significant symbolic element is the white handkerchief held in his left hand. In Renaissance art, a handkerchief, especially one held to the mouth or held in the hand, was a common symbol of death or impending death. It can be interpreted as a symbol of the \u201cashes of the dead\u201d or the \u201ctomb,\u201d representing the finality of death"

The inscription reads: \u201cIN OMNIBVS OPERIBVS TVIS MEMORARE E NOVISSI MA TVA ETINA\u00c6 ERNVM NON PECCABIS.\u201d This translates to: \u201cIn all your works, remember you will die, and you will not sin.\u201d This is a direct moral imperative derived from the Book of"

The scene is charged with profound emotional and philosophical weight, and it serves as a powerful visual embodiment of the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d concept.\n\n#### Key Elements that Represent \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1.  **The Central Act of Death**: Socrates is not depicted in agony or despair. Instead, he is calmly accepting his fate, holding the cup of poison with a serene, almost stoic expression. His posture and demeanor emphasize the acceptance of death as a natural, inevitable part of life \u2014 a direct meditation on mortality.\n\n2.  **The Contrast with the World**: On the left, his students and followers are shown in a state of emotional turmoil \u2014 some are reaching out in desperation, others are holding weapons (like the spear), symbolizing their futile attempts to save him. This contrast highlights the futility of trying to escape death and underscores the finality of the moment"

The scene is set in a richly decorated, opulent chamber, likely in the palace of his general Perdiccas, where Alexander lies dying on a bed. His body is partially covered by a red and blue cloth, and his head rests on a pillow, while his hand is being held by a grieving companion. The atmosphere is heavy with sorrow and the inevitability of death, even as the surrounding environment is one of luxury and power.\n\nThe key elements that make this image a powerful representation of \u201cMemento Mori\u201d include:\n\n1. **The Central Figure of Death**: Alexander, the greatest conqueror of his age, is shown in his final moments. His death is not a violent or sudden event but a quiet, poignant end to a life of immense achievement.

The dark, somber background strips away any sense of vitality or life, focusing the viewer\u2019s attention on the subject\u2019s fragility.\n  \n- **The Candlestick**: To the left stands a tall candlestick with a small bowl or lamp on top. This is not merely decorative; it is a classic symbol of the \u201cflickering light of life.\u201d The candle\u2019s flame represents life\u2019s brief, fragile duration \u2014 it will inevitably go out.

The woman\u2019s direct, calm gaze and the luxurious drapery of her clothing suggest a celebration of life, beauty, and status \u2014 not a meditation on death.

His posture \u2014 kneeling \u2014 is one of humility and submission, not triumph. He is not celebrating his earthly power but acknowledging his mortality.\n\n- **The Armor and the Sword**: He holds a sword, a symbol of his martial prowess and status. However, the sword is **sheathed**, and his hand is not on the hilt in a gesture of readiness or command. Instead, he holds a **rosary** \u2014 a symbol of faith and spiritual preparedness for death.

It is not merely a religious scene but a profound meditation on mortality, the inevitability of death, and the transience of earthly life.\n\n#### Key Elements Supporting the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d Theme:\n\n1.  **The Central Figure: Christ as Judge**  \n   Christ stands as the central, radiant figure, holding a staff and a scroll. His calm, authoritative gaze and the halo around his head signify his divine power and judgment. His presence is not one of condemnation, but of final, unavoidable reckoning. He is the embodiment of the finality of death and the ultimate authority over life and afterlife.\n\n2.  **The Naked Souls Before Him**  \n   The figures kneeling before Christ are depicted as naked, stripped of their earthly garments and social status. This is a powerful visual metaphor for the \u201cnaked truth\u201d of the soul before God. Their vulnerability and exposure emphasize"

This is the ultimate \"memento mori\" \u2014 the reminder that even the most revered and holy figures are subject to death and must eventually leave this world.\n    - Her calm, composed expression contrasts with the emotional reactions of those around her, emphasizing the inevitability and acceptance of death, even for the divine.\n\n2.  **The Angels: Symbols of the Divine and the Afterlife**\n    - The two angels flanking Mary"

Death is not abstract or distant; it is a concrete, immediate event being witnessed by the living. The presence of the grave-digging shovel, the open grave, and the bodies being lowered into the earth are visceral reminders of mortality.\n\n2.  **Theological and Spiritual Context:** The scene is not merely a funeral; it is a divine intervention. The Virgin Mary and saints appear from heaven, and the deceased is being taken to heaven, not to the underworld. This juxtaposition forces the viewer to confront the reality of death while simultaneously presenting the hope of salvation. This duality is central to the Memento Mori message: death is inevitable, but what comes after is"

On the left, an angel with large wings holds a staff topped with a scroll or banner, symbolizing divine message or judgment. On the right, a woman kneels in prayer, her head bowed in humility or supplication. The dark background and solemn expressions emphasize a moment of spiritual confrontation or revelation.\n\nThis image is deeply representative of \u201cMemento Mori\u201d for several reasons:\n\n- **The Angel\u2019s Symbolism**: The angel holding a scroll or banner often represents divine judgment or the announcement of death. In medieval and Renaissance art, angels are frequently depicted as messengers of God\u2019s will, which can include the call to repentance or the announcement of mortality.\n- **The Woman\u2019s Posture**: Her kneeling, prayerful stance signifies humility before the divine, acknowledging her own mortality and the need for spiritual preparation for death.

The angel is standing over a prone figure, who appears to be in a state of despair or death. The presence of the skull on the staff is a direct and unambiguous symbol of mortality. The angel\u2019s posture and the ribbon suggest a solemn, perhaps even grim, announcement of death. The overall composition evokes a sense of inevitability and finality \u2014 the moment of death is being delivered, a stark reminder that death is an inescapable reality.\n\n### Image 2: The Virgin Mary\nThis image shows the Virgin Mary in a posture of prayer or contemplation. While this image may evoke themes of piety, suffering, or divine grace, it does not directly address the concept of mortality. Mary\u2019s role is that of a spiritual figure, often associated with resurrection, salvation, and the divine, rather than the reminder of death.

The Portrait of Pope Gregory XIII (by Titian, c. 1580s):**\n\nThis painting is a masterful example of \u201cMemento Mori\u201d art. While it appears to be a formal, dignified portrait, it is subtly infused with the theme of mortality.\n\n*   **The Subject\u2019s Age and Demeanor:** Pope Gregory XIII is depicted as an elderly man with a long, grey beard and a weary, deeply lined face. His expression is not one of youthful vigor but of profound weariness and contemplation. He looks directly at the viewer with an almost piercing gaze, as if reminding us of the passage of time and the inevitability of death.\n*   **The Handkerchief:** The most significant symbolic element is the white handkerchief held in his left hand. In Renaissance art, a handkerchief, especially one held to the mouth or held in the hand, was a common symbol of death or impending death. It can be interpreted as a symbol of the \u201cashes of the dead\u201d or the \u201ctomb,\u201d representing the finality of death"

The scene is not one of violent struggle, but of serene, dignified acceptance. Socrates, standing calmly in a red robe, raises his arms to receive the cup, his face composed and his gaze directed upward, as if in contemplation or communion with the divine. His disciples and fellow citizens are gathered around him \u2014 some in anguish, others in quiet reverence \u2014 but none are depicted in a state of panic or denial. The painting captures the moment of transition from life to death with profound gravity.\n\n### Why This Image Best Represents \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1.  **Direct Engagement with Mortality**: The central action is the act of death itself \u2014 the administration of poison. Socrates is not merely *thinking* about death; he is *experiencing* it. The painting forces the viewer to confront the reality of death, not as a distant abstraction, but as an immediate, personal, and unavoidable event.\n\n2"

The scene is charged with profound emotional and philosophical weight, and it serves as a powerful visual embodiment of the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d concept.\n\n#### Key Elements that Represent \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1.  **The Central Act of Death**: Socrates is not depicted in agony or despair. Instead, he is calmly accepting his fate, holding the cup of poison with a serene, almost stoic expression. His posture and demeanor emphasize the acceptance of death as a natural, inevitable part of life \u2014 a direct meditation on mortality.\n\n2.  **The Contrast with the World**: On the left, his students and followers are shown in a state of emotional turmoil \u2014 some are reaching out in desperation, others are holding weapons (like the spear), symbolizing their futile attempts to save him. This contrast highlights the futility of trying to escape death and underscores the finality of the moment"

The concept of \u201cMemento Mori\u201d \u2014 a Latin phrase meaning \u201cRemember you must die\u201d \u2014 is often depicted in art through symbols like skulls, hourglasses, coffins, wilting flowers, or scenes of decay and mortality. Common visual representations include:\n\n- A skull or skeleton (direct reminder of death)\n- A decaying corpse or mummy\n- An hourglass or sundial (symbolizing the passage of time)\n- A wilting flower or withered tree (symbolizing the transience of life)\n- A monk or figure in contemplation of death\n\nTo properly evaluate which image best represents \u201cMemento Mori,\u201d I would need to see the actual images. Please upload the images you\u2019d like me to analyze, and I will then provide a detailed comparison and explanation of which one best embodies the theme of mortality and the impermanence of life."

The Central Theme: The Inevitability of Death**\n\n*   **Socrates\u2019 Calm Acceptance:** The painting depicts the philosopher Socrates calmly drinking the hemlock, the poison that will kill him. His serene expression and composed posture are not signs of fear, but of stoic acceptance of his fate. This is the ultimate act of confronting death head-on \u2014 not with panic, but with dignity. The \u201cMemento Mori\u201d message is not about the horror of death, but about its inevitability and the need to prepare for it with wisdom and virtue.\n\n*   **The Absence of Spectacle:** Unlike many depictions of death that show violence or horror, David presents death as a quiet, rational, and dignified event. This underscores the philosophical idea that death is a natural and unavoidable part of life \u2014 something to be met with calmness, not chaos.\n\n---\n\n**2. The Contrast Between Life"

The dark, somber background strips away any sense of vitality or life, focusing the viewer\u2019s attention on the subject\u2019s fragility.\n  \n- **The Candlestick**: To the left stands a tall candlestick with a small bowl or lamp on top. This is not merely decorative; it is a classic symbol of the \u201cflickering light of life.\u201d The candle\u2019s flame represents life\u2019s brief, fragile duration \u2014 it will inevitably go out.

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument.

Other notable Memento Mori images include: Image 4 (1536 portrait of Gottfried Werner von Wildenstein showing a nobleman kneeling in armor with a rosary, juxtaposing worldly power with spiritual humility), Image 18 (Crucifixion of Christ showing the ultimate mortality), Image 38 (a funeral scene depicting burial), and Image 43 (Saint Martin holding an hourglass symbolizing the passage of time).\", 'source': 'Image analysis results from a comprehensive review of 101 images, with detailed art historical analysis of Memento Mori symbolism and iconography', 'inference': 'Image 55', 'extra explanation': \"The concept of 'Memento Mori' (Latin for 'remember you must die') is a philosophical and artistic tradition that serves as a reminder of human mortality and the impermanence of earthly life.

While several images in the collection contain elements related to death and mortality (religious scenes of crucifixion, funeral scenes, portraits with symbolic objects), Image 55 stands out because it combines the most direct symbol (a human skull) with an explicit textual reference to the Memento Mori concept through its Latin inscription.

The scene is not one of violent struggle, but of serene, dignified acceptance. Socrates, standing calmly in a red robe, raises his arms to receive the cup, his face composed and his gaze directed upward, as if in contemplation or communion with the divine. His disciples and fellow citizens are gathered around him \u2014 some in anguish, others in quiet reverence \u2014 but none are depicted in a state of panic or denial.
