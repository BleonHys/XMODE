There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\n\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes. The backgrounds are typically simplified or focused on architectural elements to draw attention to the narrative"

There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\n\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes. The backgrounds are typically simplified or focused on architectural elements to draw attention to the narrative"

The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural.

analysis:\\\\n\\\\n-   **Scene 1 (Left):** This scene depicts figures in what appears to be a dark, possibly outdoor or semi-outdoor setting. There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\\\\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\\\\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\\\\n\\\\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes.

The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural.

There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\\\\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\\\\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\\\\n\\\\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes.

There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\\\\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\\\\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\\\\n\\\\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes.

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\n\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes. The backgrounds are typically simplified or focused on architectural elements to draw attention to the narrative"

Specifically:\n\n*   **Foliage:** Dark green leaves and vines are visible at the top of the painting, framing the figure's head and shoulders.\n*   **Trunks:** On the left and right sides of the composition, there are thick, textured vertical forms that strongly resemble tree trunks or large rock formations covered in moss and vines.\n*   **Setting:** The overall scene suggests a secluded grotto or forest clearing, a common setting in classical and romantic art to evoke a sense of nature and tranquility.\n\nTherefore, while the trees are not depicted as individual, distinct trees, the elements present are unmistakably part of a forest or wooded environment. The painting is titled \"The Fountain\" by William Walcot (1845), and the setting is intentionally naturalistic.\n\n**Yes, the image has trees (or tree-like elements) in it.**"

The way the light falls on these surfaces mimics the appearance of wood grain and bark.\n-   **The Foliage:** At the top of the image and along the right side, there are dense clusters of dark green leaves. This foliage appears to be growing from or intertwined with the tree trunks, creating a canopy or a thicket.\n-   **The Setting:** The overall composition suggests a secluded, natural setting, likely a forest glade or a wooded area, which is a common theme in classical and romantic paintings. The figure is standing on a stone ledge, with small plants and flowers at the base, reinforcing the natural, outdoor environment.\n\nWhile the trees are not depicted with full, detailed branches and leaves, the visual cues are unmistakable.

There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\n\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes.

He is depicted wearing a dark hooded robe over a lighter garment. The background is very dark and indistinct, appearing to be a simple, shadowy interior or a plain backdrop, with no visible elements of nature such as trees, foliage, or landscapes.\n\nThe painting is in a style reminiscent of the Baroque period, characterized by dramatic lighting and focused subject matter, which further emphasizes the figure and excludes environmental details like trees."

The texture and coloration \u2014 dark browns, grays, and earthy tones \u2014 are characteristic of tree bark. These form the walls of the scene, suggesting a forest or wooded grotto.\n  \n- **Foliage**: At the top and sides of the image, there are dark green leaves and vines, which are clearly part of the tree canopy or climbing vines on trees.\n\n- **Context**: The overall composition suggests a natural, outdoor setting, possibly a forest glen or a woodland fountain, which is reinforced by the presence of water and plants at the base.\n\nWhile the trees themselves may not be fully rendered as individual trees with visible branches and leaves, the presence of bark and foliage confirms that trees are a key part of the environment depicted in the painting.\n\nThis painting is **\u201cThe Fountain\u201d (1845)** by **William Holman Hunt**, and it depicts a classical nude figure (often interpreted as the nymph"

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Some images contain prominent trees in the foreground, while others show trees only in distant backgrounds. The painting 'The Source' appears multiple times (9 versions) and consistently features trees or tree-like foliage as part of the natural grotto setting. Many religious altarpieces include trees in their landscape backgrounds to provide depth and natural context to the sacred scenes."

There is a large, dark, draped object or structure, and some figures are gathered around it. However, there are no discernible trees or foliage.\\\\n-   **Scene 2 (Second from left):** This scene is set indoors, within a structure defined by columns and architectural elements. The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\\\\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\\\\n\\\\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes.

The painting 'The Source' appears multiple times (9 versions) and consistently features trees or tree-like foliage as part of the natural grotto setting. Many religious altarpieces include trees in their landscape backgrounds to provide depth and natural context to the sacred scenes."

Some images contain prominent trees in the foreground, while others show trees only in distant backgrounds. The painting 'The Source' appears multiple times (9 versions) and consistently features trees or tree-like foliage as part of the natural grotto setting. Many religious altarpieces include trees in their landscape backgrounds to provide depth and natural context to the sacred scenes."

The figures are in a hall or temple-like space. There are no trees visible.\\\\n-   **Scene 3 (Second from right):** This scene shows figures interacting, including an angel with large wings. The setting is architectural, with walls and pillars. No trees are present.\\\\n-   **Scene 4 (Right):** This scene depicts two figures in what looks like a room or a small chapel, with a desk or altar. The background is simple and architectural. There are no trees.\\\\n\\\\nThe overall style is characteristic of early Renaissance painting, which often emphasizes architectural space and human figures over natural landscapes.
