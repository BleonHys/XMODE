The dark background and the solemn, direct gaze suggest a moment of contemplation or divine presence, rather than the chaos of battle.\n\nDespite this, the **core theme is heroic** \u2014 the subject is a **heroic figure** (Saint George), and his **act of bravery** (slaying the dragon) is the foundational myth associated with him. The painting\u2019s composition, with the sword and the subject\u2019s dignified bearing, evokes heroism and martyrdom.\n\nSo, while it may not show the *drama of battle* or *rescue in progress*, it **does depict heroic",

In this particular version, likely by the Italian Renaissance artist **Titian** (circa 1510\u20131520), Saint George is shown as a youthful, noble knight holding a sword, which symbolizes his readiness for battle and his role as a defender of the innocent.\n\nAlthough the painting may appear as a portrait due to the direct gaze and the relatively calm composition, the presence of the sword and the heroic pose are clear indicators of a martial, protective, and courageous figure. Saint George\u2019s legend involves a dramatic rescue \u2014 saving a town from a dragon \u2014 which qualifies as a heroic scene.\n\nThus, the painting embodies heroic actions through:\n- The depiction of a heroic figure (Saint George)\n- The symbolic weapon (sword)\n- The implied narrative of bravery and rescue\n\n**Answer: Yes, this painting depicts heroic actions.**",

He is dressed in fashionable attire of the period \u2014 a red coat with a white cravat and ruffled cuffs \u2014 and gazes directly at the viewer with a calm, composed expression. The painting employs a dark background and focused lighting (chiaroscuro) to draw attention to the subject\u2019s face and upper body, which is characteristic of formal portraiture.\n\nThere are no elements suggesting action, danger, or heroism \u2014 no weapons, no dramatic poses, no chaotic background, and no signs of struggle or triumph. The subject appears contemplative or self-assured, not engaged in any heroic endeavor.\n\nTherefore, while the painting may depict a \u201cheroic figure\u201d in the sense of a distinguished or admirable individual (perhaps a gentleman of status or intellect), it does not portray \u201cheroic actions\u201d or \u201cdramatic heroic scenes\u201d as defined in your question.\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer: No.**",

Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

Saint George\u2019s legend involves a dramatic rescue \u2014 saving a town from a dragon \u2014 which qualifies as a heroic scene.\n\nThus, the painting embodies heroic actions through:\n- The depiction of a heroic figure (Saint George)\n- The symbolic weapon (sword)\n- The implied narrative of bravery and rescue\n\n**Answer: Yes, this painting depicts heroic actions.**",

                            "Does this painting depict heroic actions such as battles, rescues, acts of bravery, heroic figures, or dramatic heroic scenes?": "No, this painting does not depict heroic actions such as battles, rescues, acts of bravery, heroic figures, or dramatic heroic scenes.\n\nThis is a **portrait** of a man, likely from the late 18th century, shown seated and holding the back of a chair. He is dressed in fashionable attire of the period \u2014 a red coat with a white cravat and ruffled cuffs \u2014 and gazes directly at the viewer with a calm, composed expression. The painting employs a dark background and focused lighting (chiaroscuro) to draw attention to the subject\u2019s face and upper body, which is characteristic of formal portraiture.\n\nThere are no elements suggesting action, danger, or heroism \u2014 no weapons, no dramatic poses, no chaotic background, and no signs of struggle or triumph. The subject appears contemplative or self-assured, not engaged in any heroic endeavor.\n\nTherefore, while the painting may depict a \u201cheroic figure\u201d in the sense of a distinguished or admirable individual (perhaps a gentleman of status or intellect), it does not portray \u201cheroic actions\u201d or \u201cdramatic heroic scenes\u201d as defined in your question.\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer: No.**",

The user wants:\n1. Painting name (title) - available\n2. Artist - NOT available in schema\n3. Image_id - NOT available in schema (but img_path is available)\n4. Description or subject matter - NOT available in schema\n\nTo identify paintings with \"heroic actions\", I'll need to search the title field for keywords that might indicate heroic themes such as:\n- Hero, heroic\n- Battle, war, combat\n- Victory, triumph\n- Rescue, saving\n- Courage, bravery\n- Sacrifice\n- Conquest\n- Defense\n- Famous heroic figures (Hercules, Perseus, David, Judith, etc.)\n\nSince the schema doesn't have a description or subject field, I'll have to rely on the title to identify heroic themes. I'll also include the img_path since image_id is not available, and this path can be used for image analysis if needed.\n\nThe query will search for titles containing heroic-related keywords using LIKE with OR conditions.\n"

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task.

The painting references his heroic act of slaying a dragon to rescue a princess and protect a city. While shown in a moment of contemplation rather than active battle, the subject is fundamentally a heroic figure whose core narrative involves bravery and rescue.\n\n2. **Judith** (1528) - images/img_2.jpg\n   - Genre: Religious art\n   - Movement: Renaissance\n   - Heroic element: Also depicts Saint George as a youthful, noble knight holding a sword, symbolizing readiness for battle and his role as defender of the innocent. The painting embodies heroic actions through the depiction of a heroic figure, symbolic weapon, and implied narrative of bravery and rescue.\n\nThe third painting analyzed, 'Portrait of David Garrick' (1764), was determined not to depict heroic actions, as it is a formal portrait without elements suggesting action, danger, or heroism.",

The dark background and the solemn, direct gaze suggest a moment of contemplation or divine presence, rather than the chaos of battle.\\\\n\\\\nDespite this, the **core theme is heroic** \u2014 the subject is a **heroic figure** (Saint George), and his **act of bravery** (slaying the dragon) is the foundational myth associated with him. The painting\u2019s composition, with the sword and the subject\u2019s dignified bearing, evokes heroism and martyrdom.\\\\n\\\\nSo, while it may not show the *drama of battle* or *rescue in progress*, it **does depict heroic\\'}, {\\'painting_name\\': \\'Judith\\', \\'img_path\\': \\'images/img_2.jpg\\', \\'genre\\': \\'religious art\\', \\'movement\\': \\'Renaissance\\', \\'inception\\': \\'1528-01-01 00:\"002\":\"00\"\\', \\'Does this painting depict heroic actions such as battles, rescues, acts of bravery, heroic figures, or dramatic heroic scenes?\\': \\'Yes, this painting does depict heroic actions \u2014 specifically, it portrays a heroic figure.\\\\n\\\\nThe subject is **Saint George**, the patron saint of soldiers and warriors, famously depicted as a knight who slays a dragon. In this particular version, likely by the Italian Renaissance artist **Titian** (circa 1510\u20131520), Saint George is shown as a youthful, noble knight holding a sword, which symbolizes his readiness for battle and his role as a defender of the innocent.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the painting may appear as a portrait due to the direct gaze and the relatively calm composition, the presence of the sword and the heroic pose are clear indicators of a martial, protective, and courageous figure. Saint George\u2019s legend involves a dramatic rescue \u2014 saving a town from a dragon \u2014 which qualifies as a heroic scene.\\\\n\\\\nThus, the painting embodies heroic actions through:\\\\n- The depiction of a heroic figure (Saint George)\\\\n- The symbolic weapon (sword)\\\\n- The implied narrative of bravery and rescue\\\\n\\\\n**Answer: Yes, this painting depicts heroic actions.**\\'}, {\\'painting_name\\': \\'Portrait of David Garrick\\', \\'img_path\\': \\'images/img_75.jpg\\', \\'genre\\': \\'portrait\\', \\'movement\\': \\'neoclassicism\\', \\'inception\\': \\'1764-01-01 00:\"003\":\"00\"\\', \\'Does this painting depict heroic actions such as battles, rescues, acts of bravery, heroic figures, or dramatic heroic scenes?\\': \\'No, this painting does not depict heroic actions such as battles, rescues, acts of bravery, heroic figures, or dramatic heroic scenes.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a **portrait** of a man, likely from the late 18th century, shown seated and holding the back of a chair. He is dressed in fashionable attire of the period \u2014 a red coat with a white cravat and ruffled cuffs \u2014 and gazes directly at the viewer with a calm, composed expression. The painting employs a dark background and focused lighting (chiaroscuro) to draw attention to the subject\u2019s face and upper body, which is characteristic of formal portraiture.\\\\n\\\\nThere are no elements suggesting action, danger, or heroism \u2014 no weapons, no dramatic poses, no chaotic background, and no signs of struggle or triumph. The subject appears contemplative or self-assured, not engaged in any heroic endeavor.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, while the painting may depict a \u201cheroic figure\u201d in the sense of a distinguished or admirable individual (perhaps a gentleman of status or intellect), it does not portray \u201cheroic actions\u201d or \u201cdramatic heroic scenes\u201d as defined in your question.\\\\n\\\\n\u2705 **Final Answer: No.**\\'}]', additional_kwargs={'idx': 2, 'args': {'question': 'Does this painting depict heroic actions such as battles, rescues, acts of bravery, heroic figures, or dramatic heroic scenes?', 'context': '$1'}}, response_metadata={}, name='image_analysis', id='b3ef8407-c72d-4bfd-8268-128ac0ded665'), FunctionMessage(content='join', additional_kwargs={'idx': 3, 'args': ()}, response_metadata={}, name='join', id='2a942399-6dcf-424f-9ef6-bcafebf6317c')]",
