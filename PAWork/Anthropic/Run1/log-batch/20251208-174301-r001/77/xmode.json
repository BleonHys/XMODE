This indicates that the query was executed successfully but no results were found in the database. This could mean either there are no paintings in the database with sorrow as a theme/subject, or the query may not have been able to match the concept of \"sorrow\" with the available data fields. Since I have attempted to retrieve the information and received a valid response (albeit empty), I should provide this information to the user rather than replan, as replanning with the same approach is unlikely to yield different results.",
