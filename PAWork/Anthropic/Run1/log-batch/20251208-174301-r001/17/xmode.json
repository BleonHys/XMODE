This suggests either there are no paintings depicting animals in the database, the query was incorrect, or there's an issue with how the data is structured/queried. Since this is a reasonable question about art data, it's likely the query needs to be replanned to properly join tables or use correct column names to find paintings with animal subjects across different art movements.",

This could be due to several reasons: 1) The query may not have properly joined the necessary tables (paintings, movements, and subjects/themes), 2) The column or table names for identifying 'Animals' as a subject might be incorrect, 3) The filtering condition for 'Animals' might not match the actual data values in the database. We need to replan and construct a proper SQL query that: a) Joins paintings with their movements, b) Joins paintings with their subjects/themes/tags, c) Filters for animal-related subjects (considering variations like 'animal', 'animals', or specific animal types), d) Groups by movement and counts the paintings. Please retry with a corrected approach to identify the schema and construct an appropriate query. - Begin counting at : 3",
