To answer the question about how many centuries the Neoclassicism movement spans, we need to obtain the actual dates. Please replan to: 1) Try a different database query approach (perhaps searching for 'Neoclassical' or checking if the movement name is stored differently), 2) Search for alternative data sources that contain information about art/cultural movements and their time periods, or 3) Use a knowledge retrieval tool to find the historically documented dates for the Neoclassicism movement (typically documented as mid-18th to early 19th century, approximately 1750-1850). - Begin counting at : 3",
