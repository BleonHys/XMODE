They are shown in an intimate embrace in a richly decorated interior, surrounded by classical architecture, furniture, drapery, and symbolic objects like a lyre, a quiver of arrows, and statues. There are no visible animals, either as live creatures or as representations in sculpture or decoration, within the composition.\\n\\nThe focus is entirely on the human figures and their mythological narrative, consistent with the Neoclassical emphasis on idealized human form and classical themes.'}]",
