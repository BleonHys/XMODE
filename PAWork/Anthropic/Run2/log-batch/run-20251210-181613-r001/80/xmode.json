The text2SQL function returned a list of 8 paintings all classified in the nude genre. However, the results don't explicitly indicate which paintings have outdoor settings. Looking at the titles, \"The Birth of Venus\" and \"The Source\" are likely to have outdoor settings based on their mythological/natural themes. \"Mars Being Disarmed by Venus\" could also potentially be outdoors. However, without actually viewing the images or having explicit setting information in the data, I cannot definitively determine which paintings have outdoor settings. The data provided doesn't include a field for setting/location information. I should acknowledge this limitation and provide the list of nude genre paintings while noting that determining outdoor settings would require visual inspection of the images.",
