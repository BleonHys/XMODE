A figure, likely the Virgin Mary as a child, is being presented to a priest or religious figure, possibly Simeon, in a temple or church setting. Other figures, including a woman in a blue robe and a man in a white robe, are observing the event. The priest is holding a dark cloth, perhaps a veil or a mantle, while the child is held by another figure.\\n\\n2.  **The Annunciation to the Virgin Mary:** The second panel depicts the Annunciation. The angel Gabriel, identifiable by his wings and golden halo, kneels before the Virgin Mary, who stands with a blue cloak and a red garment. Gabriel is presenting a lily or a starburst symbol, representing the divine message'}]",
