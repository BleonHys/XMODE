                "Summary": "Based on the analysis of 14 paintings, four paintings clearly depict heroic actions: 'The Oath of the Horatii' (1784 and 1785 versions), 'The Death of General Wolfe' (1770), and 'The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons' (1789).",
                "details": "The paintings were analyzed for depictions of heroic actions, which include acts of courage, sacrifice, moral resolve, and civic duty. The following paintings were identified as depicting heroic actions:\n\n1. **The Oath of the Horatii (1784 & 1785)** by Jacques-Louis David - Depicts three Roman brothers swearing an oath to fight to the death for Rome, showing heroism through sacrifice for the state and moral resolve.\n\n2. **The Death of General Wolfe (1770)** by Benjamin West - Portrays General James Wolfe dying heroically after leading his troops to victory at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, representing heroism through sacrifice and leadership.\n\n3. **The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789)** by Jacques-Louis David - Depicts moral and civic heroism, showing the courageous act of standing up for justice and the rights of the people.\n\nOther paintings analyzed did NOT depict heroic actions, including portraits, mythological scenes of romance or intimacy, and scenes focused on emotional or philosophical moments rather than acts of valor.",

                    "The Oath of the Horatii (1785)",

                ],
                "extra explanation": "The concept of 'heroic actions' in these paintings encompasses both traditional martial heroism (battlefield courage and sacrifice) and moral/civic heroism (standing up for principles, duty to the state, and moral courage). Neoclassical paintings often emphasized these themes of virtue, sacrifice, and civic duty. Some paintings like 'The Death of Socrates' depict intellectual and moral courage but were noted as not being heroic in the 'conventional sense' of physical valor. Several paintings had incomplete analysis results (empty responses for 'The Death of Marat' versions, 'Antiochus and Stratonice', and 'The Intervention of the Sabine Women'), but based on available information, these four paintings clearly meet the criteria for depicting heroic actions."
