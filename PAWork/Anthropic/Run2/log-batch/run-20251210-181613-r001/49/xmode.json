                "extra explanation": "The order of appearance corresponds to the ID numbers in the dataset (1-101). Several titles appear multiple times because the dataset contains duplicate entries or multiple views of the same artwork. Angels in these images take various forms: traditional winged angels with halos in religious scenes, cherubs (childlike winged figures), and putti (decorative winged children common in Renaissance and Baroque art). Some images (IDs 70, 71, 72, 95, 96) had empty analysis responses and could not be definitively classified. Image ID 4 has a German title that translates to 'The Mother of God crowned by angels with Child in the circle of the 14 patron saints of the House of Zimmern,' explicitly indicating angel presence in the title itself."
