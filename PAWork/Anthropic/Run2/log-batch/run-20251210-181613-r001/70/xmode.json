However, the text2SQL function returned an empty dataset (status: success, data: []), and consequently the image_analysis function also returned an empty array []. This indicates that either: 1) the database query didn't find any matching paintings, 2) there was an issue with the query formulation, or 3) the database doesn't contain paintings with these specific themes tagged. Since no data was retrieved, I cannot provide any paintings that depict both love and death. I should provide a response indicating that no paintings were found matching these criteria based on the available data.",
