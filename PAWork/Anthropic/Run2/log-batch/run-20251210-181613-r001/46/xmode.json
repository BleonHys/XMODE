                "extra explanation": "The analysis was performed by examining visual content of each image. Images were identified as containing trees if they showed: tree trunks, branches, foliage, leaves, wooded settings, or forested backgrounds. Some images had trees as prominent features in the foreground, while others had trees visible in background landscapes. Religious paintings often included trees in outdoor scenes or visible through windows/doorways. Several versions of 'The Source' painting feature wooded settings with tree trunks and foliage framing the central figure."
