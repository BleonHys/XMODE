They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'}, {'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis', 'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\n\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'}, {'title': 'The Birth of Venus', 'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **“The Birth of Venus”** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-Léon Gérôme**. It depicts the mythological scene of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a seashell.\\n\\nWhile the painting is rich with human figures, there are no actual animals depicted in it. The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\n\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus,” but this is Gérôme’s version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'}, {'title': 'Paris and Helen', 'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\n\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\n\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible. The scene appears to be a mythological or allegorical representation, possibly from ancient Greek or Roman art, featuring human figures and classical motifs.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.**'}]",
