These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\n\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\n\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\n\n*   **Doves (2)**\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\n\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child",

These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\n\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\n\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\n\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\n\n*   **Doves (2)**\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\n\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child",

In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\n\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\n\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\n\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\n\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted",

It depicts the mythological scene of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a seashell.\n\nWhile the painting is rich with human figures, there are no actual animals depicted in it. The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\n\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus,\u201d but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*",

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\n\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'The Birth of Venus',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\"The Birth of Venus\"** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**. It depicts the mythological scene of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a seashell.\\n\\nWhile the painting is rich with human figures, there are no actual animals depicted in it. The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\n\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus,\" but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me's version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Paris and Helen',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\n\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\n\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\\\n\\\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'}, {'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis', 'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'}, {'title': 'The Birth of Venus', 'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**. It depicts the mythological scene of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a seashell.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the painting is rich with human figures, there are no actual animals depicted in it. The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\\\n\\\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus,\u201d but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'}, {'title': 'Paris and Helen', 'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\\\n\\\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\\\n\\\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\n\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'The Birth of Venus',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\"The Birth of Venus\"** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**.

The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\n\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus,\" but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me's version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Paris and Helen',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\n\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\n\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible.

In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\n\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'The Birth of Venus',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\"The Birth of Venus\"** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**. It depicts the mythological scene of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a seashell.\\n\\nWhile the painting is rich with human figures, there are no actual animals depicted in it. The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\n\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus,\" but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me's version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Paris and Helen',\n        'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg',\n        'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\n\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\n\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares).

This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\n\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\n\n*   **Doves (2)**\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\n\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child",

These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\n\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving.

For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

The scene appears to be a mythological or allegorical representation, possibly from ancient Greek or Roman art, featuring human figures and classical motifs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.**",

The user wants the painting title and image_id returned.\n\nLooking at the schema, there is no explicit 'image_id' column, but there is 'img_path' which serves as a unique identifier for each image. I'll return both 'title' and 'img_path' as the image identifier.\n\nSince determining whether a painting depicts animals requires visual analysis of the images, I'll need to retrieve the img_path so that image analysis can be performed. I'll filter for mythological genre paintings and return the title and img_path.\n\nThe query will:\n- SELECT title and img_path (as the image identifier)\n- FROM paintings table\n- WHERE genre contains 'mytholog' to catch variations like 'mythological painting', 'mythology', etc.\n"

Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'}, {'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis', 'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\n\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'}, {'title': 'The Birth of Venus', 'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**. It depicts the mythological scene of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a seashell.\\n\\nWhile the painting is rich with human figures, there are no actual animals depicted in it. The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants. These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\n\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus,\u201d but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'}, {'title': 'Paris and Helen', 'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\n\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\n\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\n\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\n\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\n\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\n\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'}, {'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis', 'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\n\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\n\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\n\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\n\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\n\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'}, {'title': 'The Birth of Venus', 'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**.

The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants.

They are perched on the leg of the central female figure (Aphrodite) and near the foot of the male figure (Ares). In Greek mythology, doves are often symbols of peace, love, and purity, which fits the context of the scene.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Horse (on the shield):** The shield held by the figure on the far right (Aphrodite) features a detailed depiction of a horse. This is not a live animal but a painted image on the shield. The horse is likely a reference to the mythological creature that pulled the chariot of the god of war, Ares.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the animals depicted in the image are:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Doves (2)**\\\\n*   **Horse (1, depicted on a shield)**\\\\n\\\\nThe other figures are mythological gods and goddesses (Ares, Aphrodite, and the Graces) and a small winged child'}, {'title': 'Jupiter and Thetis', 'img_path': 'images/img_77.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, here are the animals depicted:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Eagle**: A large, dark eagle is prominently featured perched on the right side of the throne, next to the main figure. In Greco-Roman mythology, the eagle is a sacred symbol of Zeus/Jupiter, often associated with him as his divine messenger or a representation of his power and dominion over the skies.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Horse**: While not a living animal, there are sculpted representations of horses on the golden throne base. These are part of a relief carving, likely depicting a chariot or battle scene, which is a common motif associated with Zeus/Jupiter, who is often portrayed as a charioteer of the clouds.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Lion**: Also depicted as a sculpted relief on the throne base, a lion is visible among the other figures in the carving. Lions are symbols of strength and royalty, fitting for the king of the gods.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Other Figures (Human, Not Animal)**: There is a small, winged figure (possibly a putto or a minor deity) in the upper left corner holding a staff. This is a human-like figure, not an animal.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the only actual animals depicted'}, {'title': 'The Birth of Venus', 'img_path': 'images/img_90.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'This is a famous painting titled **\u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d** (1876) by the French artist **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**.

The only non-human figures are **cherubs (putti)**, which are mythological or religious figures often depicted as winged infants.

These cherubs are shown in the sky above and around the central figures.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.** The painting contains only human figures (gods, goddesses, and cherubs) and mythological elements like seashells and waves.\\n\\n*(Note: The painting is sometimes confused with Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus,\u201d but this is G\u00e9r\u00f4me\u2019s version, which is more realistic and includes more figures.)*'}, {'title': 'Paris and Helen', 'img_path': 'images/img_97.jpg', 'What animals are depicted in this image?': 'Based on the image provided, there are no animals depicted.\\n\\nThe painting shows two human figures in a classical setting:\\n- A woman in a draped garment leaning affectionately toward a seated man.\\n- The man is partially nude, wearing a red cap and blue drapery, and holding a lyre.\\n\\nThe background contains architectural elements, statues, and decorative objects, but no animals are visible. The scene appears to be a mythological or allegorical representation, possibly from ancient Greek or Roman art, featuring human figures and classical motifs.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is: **There are no animals depicted in this image.**'}]",
