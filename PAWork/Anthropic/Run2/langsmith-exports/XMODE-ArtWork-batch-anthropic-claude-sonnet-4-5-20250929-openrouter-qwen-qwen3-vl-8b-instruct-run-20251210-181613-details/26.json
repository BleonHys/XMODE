His helmet is off, revealing his face, and he is holding a rosary, suggesting a moment of prayer or contemplation.

The skull is the most direct and potent symbol of mortality in Western art and culture, stripped of all flesh and identity, reminding the viewer of the final, universal state to which all humans are destined. The skull is rendered with remarkable realism and detail, making the abstract concept of death tangible and visceral.

This moment is not merely a display of power, but a revelation of his divine nature to his disciples. Crucially, this event occurs *after* Jesus has foretold his suffering and death in Jerusalem (Mark 8:31, Matthew 16:21, Luke 9:22). The transfiguration is a divine affirmation that his suffering and death are not a defeat, but a necessary path to resurrection and glory.

It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross \u2014 the ultimate and most visceral symbol of death.

The scene is not one of terror or despair, but of stoic acceptance and moral clarity. The central figure, Socrates, sits calmly on a simple wooden chair, his gaze steady and his expression serene, even as he holds the cup of poison. His posture and demeanor embody the Stoic ideal of accepting death as a natural and inevitable part of life, a concept deeply tied to the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d philosophy.\\n\\nThe composition reinforces this theme:\\n\\n- **The Death of Socrates (Central Figure):** Socrates is the focal point, and his calm acceptance of death is the core message. He is not depicted in agony or fear, but as a man who has lived a life of virtue and is now peacefully facing his end.

The composition and symbolism are rich with \u201cMemento Mori\u201d implications:\\n\\n1.  **The Chaise Longue as a Symbol of Deathbed or Resting Place**: While the woman appears alive and composed, the chaise longue itself is an object of death and final rest. In historical art, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, reclining figures on such furniture were often depicted as \u201cSleeping Beauties\u201d or as allegories of Death.

The veil also evokes the shroud of the dead.\n\n2.  **The Skull in the Mantle**: Perhaps the most direct and powerful symbol is the skull (or a skull-like object) visible within the folds of her black mantle, near her left shoulder.

He is surrounded by two angels, one on each side. His body is pale, wounded, and bloodied, with a crown of thorns still on his head. He is semi-nude, draped in a cloth that reveals his wounds. The tomb itself is ornate, with Hebrew inscriptions (likely \u201cHamiyta\u201d meaning \u201cdeath\u201d or \u201ckilled\u201d).\n\n**Key elements:**"

He is not shown in a state of agony or decay, but rather in a peaceful, almost serene state, suggesting the transition from earthly life to eternal life. His body is being lifted, symbolizing the soul\u2019s ascent to God. This is a powerful visual"

His presence is not merely spiritual but actively punitive and evaluative.\n   - His gaze is direct and unflinching, compelling the viewer to confront their own fate.

The Central Theme: The Transfiguration as a Moment of Divine Revelation and Mortal Limitation**\nThe painting shows Jesus Christ transfigured on a mountaintop, radiating divine light, with his face and clothes glowing. This moment is not merely a display of power, but a revelation of his divine nature to his disciples. Crucially, this event occurs *after* Jesus has foretold his suffering and death in Jerusalem (Mark 8:31, Matthew 16:21, Luke 9:22). The transfiguration is a divine affirmation that his suffering and death are not a defeat, but a necessary path to resurrection and glory. The disciples\u2019 awe and the angels\u2019 presence emphasize the sacredness of the moment, yet the painting\u2019s composition and context are steeped in the reality of human frailty and mortality.

The central figure, Saint Catherine, is depicted as a saintly martyr, but her presentation is not one of triumph or glory. Instead, it is one of solemn reflection and the stark reality of death.

Bones are the universal, unchanging remnants of the human body after death. Their presence in the painting serves as a constant, visceral reminder that all flesh and glory are temporary.

This painting contains none of these. The saints are shown in a moment of religious instruction or conversation, with one holding a book (likely scripture).

His eyes are half-lidded, his brow furrowed, and his expression conveys exhaustion and resignation \u2014 all visual cues of a body and spirit nearing the end of life. The Crown of Thorns, a symbol of humiliation and agony, is not merely decorative; it is actively causing bleeding, a visceral reminder of physical decay and mortality. This is not a glorified or triumphant Christ, but one in the throes of human suffering \u2014 a stark confrontation with death.\n\n> *Memento Mori* invites the viewer to confront the inevitability of death. Here, Christ\u2019s suffering is not abstract \u2014 it is immediate, bodily, and unavoidable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Halo as Ironic"

Her pose is graceful and classical, and her expression is serene and contemplative.\n\n**Why it best represents \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:**\n\nWhile the scene is idyllic and appears to celebrate beauty and life, the painting is rich with symbolic undertones of mortality.\n\n1.  **The Flowing Water as a Metaphor for Time and Death**: Water is a powerful symbol in art and philosophy. In this context, the water pouring from the jug is not merely a source of refreshment but a representation of the unstoppable flow of time. Time, like water, is finite and inexorable \u2014 it will eventually lead to death. The water is also a symbol of life\u2019s transience; it is beautiful, vital, and yet it is constantly changing and disappearing"

The scene is not one of terror or despair, but of stoic acceptance and moral clarity. The central figure, Socrates, sits calmly on a simple wooden chair, his gaze steady and his expression serene, even as he holds the cup of poison. His posture and demeanor embody the Stoic ideal of accepting death as a natural and inevitable part of life, a concept deeply tied to the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d philosophy.\n\nThe composition reinforces this theme:\n\n- **The Death of Socrates (Central Figure):** Socrates is the focal point, and his calm acceptance of death is the core message. He is not depicted in agony or fear, but as a man who has lived a life of virtue and is now peacefully facing his end. This is the ultimate \u201cMemento Mori\u201d \u2014 a reminder that death is inevitable, but how one faces it defines one\u2019s character.\n  \n- **"

The composition and symbolism are rich with \u201cMemento Mori\u201d implications:\n\n1.  **The Chaise Longue as a Symbol of Deathbed or Resting Place**: While the woman appears alive and composed, the chaise longue itself is an object of death and final rest. In historical art, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, reclining figures on such furniture were often depicted as \u201cSleeping Beauties\u201d or as allegories of Death. The pose is passive and vulnerable \u2014 a state of repose that could easily be interpreted as the final rest before death.\n\n2.  **"

What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

The image you have provided \u2014 a portrait of a woman holding a sword and a small dog \u2014 is not a depiction of death or mortality in the way that \u201cMemento Mori\u201d typically demands. It is, in fact, a portrait of **Saint Catherine of Alexandria**, painted by the Italian Renaissance artist **Titian** (circa 1515\u20131520). She is identifiable by the sword (a symbol of her martyrdom) and the dog (a reference to her legend, where she was said to have been accompanied by a dog during her execution).

It is a classic example of the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d genre, which was popular in the late medieval and Renaissance periods as a reminder of death and the fleeting nature of earthly life.\n\n#### Key elements that convey \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1. **The Kneeling Knight in Armor**:\n   - The knight is depicted in full plate armor, a symbol of earthly power, status, and military prowess \u2014 the very things society values. Yet, he is kneeling, which is a posture of humility, submission, and prayer. This juxtaposition \u2014 the powerful warrior kneeling before death \u2014 is a direct visual metaphor for the inevitability of mortality.

He is not depicted in a battle scene or a triumphant pose, but in a posture of humility and submission. His helmet is off, revealing his face, and he is holding a rosary, suggesting a moment of prayer or contemplation. This immediately signals a spiritual or existential moment \u2014 a pause in the midst of worldly life to reflect on the soul\u2019s fate.\n\n### 2. The Symbolism of the Armor\nThe armor is not just protective gear; it is a symbol of the knight\u2019s earthly identity and status. It represents the \u201cbody\u201d or the \u201cself\u201d that is mortal and"

While it appears to be a formal portrait, its underlying theme is deeply rooted in the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d tradition, which was especially prominent in Northern Renaissance art.\n\n#### Key Symbolic Elements:\n\n1.  **The Veiled Figure and Black Dress**: The subject is dressed in black, the traditional color of mourning and death. Her face is partially covered by a white veil, which obscures her expression and suggests anonymity \u2014 a reminder that death comes to all, regardless of status or beauty. The veil also evokes the shroud of the dead.\n\n2.  **The Skull in the Mantle**: Perhaps the most direct and powerful symbol is the skull (or a skull-like object) visible within the folds of her black mantle, near her left shoulder.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of its key components:\n\n1.  **The Figure\u2019s Attire and Demeanor:**\n    *   The woman is dressed in a **black robe and a white wimple**, which are traditional garments associated with **mourning and religious devotion**. Her head is bowed, and her gaze is directed downward, suggesting **contemplation, humility, or sorrow**. This posture is not one of worldly celebration but of quiet reflection on life\u2019s fragility.\n\n2.  **The Setting and Symbolism:**\n    *   The background features a **grand, ornate architectural structure** with **clocks**. The most prominent is a large, ornate clock tower. Clocks are a classic *memento mori* symbol, representing the **passage of time** and the **inevitability of death** \u2014 time is the most constant reminder that life is finite."

Crucially, this event occurs *after* Jesus has foretold his suffering and death in Jerusalem (Mark 8:31, Matthew 16:21, Luke 9:22). The transfiguration is a divine affirmation that his suffering and death are not a defeat, but a necessary path to resurrection and glory.

Central Panel: Crucifixion of Christ**\n\nThis is the most powerful and direct representation of mortality. It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross \u2014 the ultimate and most visceral symbol of death. The scene is framed by the Virgin Mary and other mourners, emphasizing the human cost and emotional weight of death. Crucifixion is not merely an event; it is the central theological event of Christianity, representing the sacrifice for humanity\u2019s salvation and the inevitability of death. The raw, physical suffering and the starkness of the cross serve as a direct, unambiguous reminder that death is an unavoidable fate for all humans. The image is not just about death; it is about the cosmic and personal significance of mortality \u2014 a universal truth that transcends time and culture.\n\n---\n\n**2.

The central figure, Saint Catherine, is depicted as a saintly martyr, but her presentation is not one of triumph or glory. Instead, it is one of solemn reflection and the stark reality of death. The key elements that make this image the most representative are:\n\n1.  **The Bones:** The most explicit and direct symbol of mortality is the pile of human bones at her feet and the bones she holds in her lap. Bones are the universal, unchanging remnants of the human body after death. Their presence in the painting serves as a constant, visceral reminder that all flesh and glory are temporary. The saint is not shown in a state of decay, but she is surrounded by the very material evidence of decay, forcing the viewer to confront the inevitability of death.

The image you have provided \u2014 a portrait of a woman holding a sword and a small dog \u2014 is not a depiction of death or mortality in the way that \u201cMemento Mori\u201d typically demands. It is, in fact, a portrait of **Saint Catherine of Alexandria**, painted by the Italian Renaissance artist **Titian** (circa 1515\u20131520). She is identifiable by the sword (a symbol of her martyrdom) and the dog (a reference to her legend, where she was said to have been accompanied by a dog during her execution). The painting is a **martyrdom portrait**, not a memento mori.\n\n**Memento Mori** is a Latin phrase meaning \u201cRemember that you must die.\u201d It is a visual and philosophical reminder of human mortality, often depicted in art through symbols like skulls, hourglasses, wilting flowers, bones, or decaying bodies. The purpose is to contemplate death and the fleeting nature of earthly life.\n\nSince you\u2019ve only provided one image, and it does not depict any of the traditional memento mori symbols (skull, hourglass, etc.), I must conclude that **none of the images provided"

It is a classic example of the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d genre, which was popular in the late medieval and Renaissance periods as a reminder of death and the fleeting nature of earthly life.\n\n#### Key elements that convey \u201cMemento Mori\u201d:\n\n1. **The Kneeling Knight in Armor**:\n   - The knight is depicted in full plate armor, a symbol of earthly power, status, and military prowess \u2014 the very things society values. Yet, he is kneeling, which is a posture of humility, submission, and prayer. This juxtaposition \u2014 the powerful warrior kneeling before death \u2014 is a direct visual metaphor for the inevitability of mortality. His armor, while impressive, is useless against death, which is the ultimate equalizer.\n\n2. **The Rosary**:\n   - The knight"

The Subject and Context: A Knight in Armor, Kneeling in Prayer\nThe central figure is a knight, Gottfried Werner von Wildenstein, kneeling in full plate armor. He is not depicted in a battle scene or a triumphant pose, but in a posture of humility and submission. His helmet is off, revealing his face, and he is holding a rosary, suggesting a moment of prayer or contemplation. This immediately signals a spiritual or existential moment \u2014 a pause in the midst of worldly life to reflect on the soul\u2019s fate.\n\n### 2. The Symbolism of the Armor\nThe armor is not just protective gear; it is a symbol of the knight\u2019s earthly identity and status. It represents the \u201cbody\u201d or the \u201cself\u201d that is mortal and"

While it appears to be a formal portrait, its underlying theme is deeply rooted in the \u201cMemento Mori\u201d tradition, which was especially prominent in Northern Renaissance art.\n\n#### Key Symbolic Elements:\n\n1.  **The Veiled Figure and Black Dress**: The subject is dressed in black, the traditional color of mourning and death. Her face is partially covered by a white veil, which obscures her expression and suggests anonymity \u2014 a reminder that death comes to all, regardless of status or beauty. The veil also evokes the shroud of the dead.\n\n2.  **The Skull in the Mantle**: Perhaps the most direct and powerful symbol is the skull (or a skull-like object) visible within the folds of her black mantle, near her left shoulder. This is a classic *memento mori* symbol \u2014 the skull representing death. Its placement, partially hidden but still"

His death is sudden and tragic, emphasizing how quickly life can be extinguished \u2014 even for a holy person.

The Central Theme: The Transfiguration as a Moment of Divine Revelation and Mortal Limitation**\nThe painting shows Jesus Christ transfigured on a mountaintop, radiating divine light, with his face and clothes glowing. This moment is not merely a display of power, but a revelation of his divine nature to his disciples. Crucially, this event occurs *after* Jesus has foretold his suffering and death in Jerusalem (Mark 8:31, Matthew 16:21, Luke 9:22). The transfiguration is a divine affirmation that his suffering and death are not a defeat, but a necessary path to resurrection and glory. The disciples\u2019 awe and the angels\u2019 presence emphasize the sacredness of the moment, yet the painting\u2019s composition and context are steeped in the reality of human frailty and mortality. The figures below are earthly, mortal beings who are witnessing something beyond their comprehension \u2014 a stark reminder of"

Central Panel: Crucifixion of Christ**\n\nThis is the most powerful and direct representation of mortality. It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross \u2014 the ultimate and most visceral symbol of death. The scene is framed by the Virgin Mary and other mourners, emphasizing the human cost and emotional weight of death. Crucifixion is not merely an event; it is the central theological event of Christianity, representing the sacrifice for humanity\u2019s salvation and the inevitability of death. The raw, physical suffering and the starkness of the cross serve as a direct, unambiguous reminder that death is an unavoidable fate for all humans. The image is not just about death; it is about the cosmic and personal significance of mortality \u2014 a universal truth that transcends time and culture.\n\n---\n\n**2.

The central figure, Saint Catherine, is depicted as a saintly martyr, but her presentation is not one of triumph or glory. Instead, it is one of solemn reflection and the stark reality of death. The key elements that make this image the most representative are:\n\n1.  **The Bones:** The most explicit and direct symbol of mortality is the pile of human bones at her feet and the bones she holds in her lap. Bones are the universal, unchanging remnants of the human body after death. Their presence in the painting serves as a constant, visceral reminder that all flesh and glory are temporary. The saint is not shown in a state of decay, but she is surrounded by the very material evidence of decay, forcing the viewer to confront the inevitability of death.

The angel\u2019s gaze is directed toward the figure on the right, suggesting a message is being delivered. The scroll often symbolizes divine revelation or judgment.\n\n*   **Right Panel:** A woman (likely the Virgin Mary or a saint) in a humble,"

The staff it holds is not a symbol of peace or power, but a **symbol of death**. The scroll wrapped around the staff is a classic iconographic element representing the **\u201cscroll of death\u201d** or the **\u201cbook of fate\u201d**\u2014a direct visual metaphor for the end of life. The angel\u2019s gaze is directed toward the human figure, suggesting a divine announcement or a summons to face mortality. This is a direct, unambiguous representation of death as an inescapable force.\n\n#### 2. **The Scroll as a Literal Reminder of Mortality**\nThe scroll is not merely decorative.

He is not depicted in agony or fear, but as a man who has lived a life of virtue and is now peacefully facing his end. This is the ultimate \u201cMemento Mori\u201d \u2014 a reminder that death is inevitable, but how one faces it defines one\u2019s character.\n  \n- **"

He is not depicted in agony or fear. Instead, he is calmly accepting his death sentence, holding a scroll (possibly his final philosophical writings) and looking toward the executioner. His serene expression and posture embody the Stoic acceptance of fate. This is the ultimate \u201cmemento mori\u201d \u2014 confronting death not with terror, but with philosophical clarity and dignity.\n\n2.  **The Executioner and the Rope**  \n    The executioner, positioned behind Socrates, holds the rope that will be used to hang him.

The composition and symbolism are rich with \u201cMemento Mori\u201d implications:\n\n1.  **The Chaise Longue as a Symbol of Deathbed or Resting Place**: While the woman appears alive and composed, the chaise longue itself is an object of death and final rest. In historical art, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, reclining figures on such furniture were often depicted as \u201cSleeping Beauties\u201d or as allegories of Death. The pose is passive and vulnerable \u2014 a state of repose that could easily be interpreted as the final rest before death.\n\n2.  **"

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

The Subject and Context: A Knight in Armor, Kneeling in Prayer\\nThe central figure is a knight, Gottfried Werner von Wildenstein, kneeling in full plate armor. He is not depicted in a battle scene or a triumphant pose, but in a posture of humility and submission. His helmet is off, revealing his face, and he is holding a rosary, suggesting a moment of prayer or contemplation. This immediately signals a spiritual or existential moment \u2014 a pause in the midst of worldly life to reflect on the soul\u2019s fate.\\n\\n### 2. The Symbolism of the Armor\\nThe armor is not just protective gear; it is a symbol of the knight\u2019s earthly identity and status.

Her face is partially covered by a white veil, which obscures her expression and suggests anonymity \u2014 a reminder that death comes to all, regardless of status or beauty. The veil also evokes the shroud of the dead.\\n\\n2.  **The Skull in the Mantle**: Perhaps the most direct and powerful symbol is the skull (or a skull-like object) visible within the folds of her black mantle, near her left shoulder.

The skull is the most direct and potent symbol of mortality in Western art and culture, stripped of all flesh and identity, reminding the viewer of the final, universal state to which all humans are destined. The skull is rendered with remarkable realism and detail, making the abstract concept of death tangible and visceral. The Latin inscription explicitly reinforces the Memento Mori message, derived from the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes, serving as a moral exhortation.\", 'source': 'Image analysis of 101 images (img_0.jpg through img_100.jpg) using visual content analysis', 'inference': 'Image 55 (images/img_55.jpg)', 'extra explanation': 'While several other images also strongly represent Memento Mori themes - including Image 4 (knight kneeling in armor, circa 1536), Images 6-7 (Portrait of Apollonia von Grumburg with skull symbolism), and Images 48-49 (Christ crowned with thorns) - Image 55 stands out as the most iconic and universal representation.

The Central Theme: The Transfiguration as a Moment of Divine Revelation and Mortal Limitation**\\\\nThe painting shows Jesus Christ transfigured on a mountaintop, radiating divine light, with his face and clothes glowing. This moment is not merely a display of power, but a revelation of his divine nature to his disciples. Crucially, this event occurs *after* Jesus has foretold his suffering and death in Jerusalem (Mark 8:31, Matthew 16:21, Luke 9:22). The transfiguration is a divine affirmation that his suffering and death are not a defeat, but a necessary path to resurrection and glory. The disciples\u2019 awe and the angels\u2019 presence emphasize the sacredness of the moment, yet the painting\u2019s composition and context are steeped in the reality of human frailty and mortality.

Central Panel: Crucifixion of Christ**\\\\n\\\\nThis is the most powerful and direct representation of mortality. It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross \u2014 the ultimate and most visceral symbol of death. The scene is framed by the Virgin Mary and other mourners, emphasizing the human cost and emotional weight of death. Crucifixion is not merely an event; it is the central theological event of Christianity, representing the sacrifice for humanity\u2019s salvation and the inevitability of death. The raw, physical suffering and the starkness of the cross serve as a direct, unambiguous reminder that death is an unavoidable fate for all humans. The image is not just about death; it is about the cosmic and personal significance of mortality \u2014 a universal truth that transcends time and culture.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n**2.

Bones are the universal, unchanging remnants of the human body after death. Their presence in the painting serves as a constant, visceral reminder that all flesh and glory are temporary.

The scene is not one of terror or despair, but of stoic acceptance and moral clarity.
