It depicts Jupiter (Zeus) in his guise as a bull, but in this version, he is shown as a bearded man seated on a throne, holding a scepter, with Io (a mortal woman) kneeling before him. Io is depicted as a nude woman, and she is looking directly at the viewer, establishing a direct and intimate connection. Her gaze is not directed at Jupiter, but rather at the viewer, which creates a sense of engagement and draws the viewer into the scene.\n\nThis direct gaze is a deliberate artistic choice that adds to the emotional and narrative power of the painting, inviting the viewer to participate in the moment and perhaps to question their own role in the mythological drama unfolding before them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**."

It depicts Jupiter (Zeus) in his guise as a bull, but in this version, he is shown as a bearded man seated on a throne, holding a scepter, with Io (a mortal woman) kneeling before him. Io is depicted as a nude woman, and she is looking directly at the viewer, establishing a direct and intimate connection. Her gaze is not directed at Jupiter, but rather at the viewer, which creates a sense of engagement and draws the viewer into the scene.\n\nThis direct gaze is a deliberate artistic choice that adds to the emotional and narrative power of the painting, inviting the viewer to participate in the moment and perhaps to question their own role in the mythological drama unfolding before them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**."

The figure is often interpreted as a classical nymph or a symbol of purity and grace, and the direct gaze is a key element in engaging the viewer.\n\nThe direct eye contact is not accidental; it's a hallmark of Bouguereau's style, designed to create an intimate and often sensual connection between"

Io is depicted as a nude woman, and she is looking directly at the viewer, establishing a direct and intimate connection.

It depicts Jupiter (Zeus) in his guise as a bull, but in this version, he is shown as a bearded man seated on a throne, holding a scepter, with Io (a mortal woman) kneeling before him. Io is depicted as a nude woman, and she is looking directly at the viewer, establishing a direct and intimate connection. Her gaze is not directed at Jupiter, but rather at the viewer, which creates a sense of engagement and draws the viewer into the scene.\n\nThis direct gaze is a deliberate artistic choice that adds to the emotional and narrative power of the painting, inviting the viewer to participate in the moment and perhaps to question their own role in the mythological drama unfolding before them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**.",

It depicts Jupiter (Zeus) in his guise as a bull, but in this version, he is shown as a bearded man seated on a throne, holding a scepter, with Io (a mortal woman) kneeling before him. Io is depicted as a nude woman, and she is looking directly at the viewer, establishing a direct and intimate connection. Her gaze is not directed at Jupiter, but rather at the viewer, which creates a sense of engagement and draws the viewer into the scene.\n\nThis direct gaze is a deliberate artistic choice that adds to the emotional and narrative power of the painting, inviting the viewer to participate in the moment and perhaps to question their own role in the mythological drama unfolding before them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **yes**.",

Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Io is depicted as a nude woman, and she is looking directly at the viewer, establishing a direct and intimate connection.

This is a deliberate compositional choice to create a sense of connection and intimacy.\\\\n-   **The Pose:** Her pose is relaxed yet deliberate. She holds a large clay jug over her shoulder, pouring water, which suggests a mythological or allegorical theme (perhaps the goddess of spring or a nymph). However, despite the narrative context, her gaze is not directed at the jug or the water; it is fixed on the viewer.\\\\n\\\\nThis direct gaze is a powerful element in the painting, intended to draw the viewer into the scene and create a personal, almost confrontational, interaction.\\\\n\\\\nThe artwork is **\"The Fountain\" (1845)** by the French painter **Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me**.

The central figure is Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea. Ingres was known for his idealized, classical style and his mastery of the human form.

The central figure is Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea. Ingres was known for his idealized, classical style and his mastery of the human form.
