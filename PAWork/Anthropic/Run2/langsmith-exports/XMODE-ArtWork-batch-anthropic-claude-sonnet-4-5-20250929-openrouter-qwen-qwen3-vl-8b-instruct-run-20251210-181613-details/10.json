He does not resist physically, but his posture and expression convey profound moral courage and resolve. He is not fleeing or fighting back; he is standing his ground with dignity, facing death for his principles.\n\n2.  **Moral Courage over Physical Strength:** The heroism here is not of the warrior or the conqueror, but of the intellectual and the moral individual. Socrates chooses to die rather than compromise his philosophical beliefs, which is a form of ultimate heroism in the classical and Enlightenment tradition.\n\n3.  **David\u2019s Neoclassical Ideal:** David, a leading figure of the Neoclassical movement, was inspired by ancient Greek ideals of virtue, reason, and civic duty.

Their heroism lies in placing the collective good above personal safety or family ties.\n\n2. **Moral Resolve**: The men are stoic, determined, and unified.

Achilles is seated, reclining comfortably, while Patroclus lies across his lap \u2014 a scene of tenderness and closeness, not of martial valor.\n- **The setting**: They are on a cloud, suggesting a mythological or divine realm, with architectural elements and other figures (possibly goddesses or attendants) in the background. The atmosphere is serene and romantic, not martial.\n- **The symbolism**: The presence of doves (symbols of peace or love), the laurel wreath (often associated with victory, but here it\u2019s worn casually), and the overall calmness of the scene point toward themes of love, friendship, and personal connection \u2014 not heroism in the traditional sense.\n- **The context**:"

The figures around him\u2014such as the woman kneeling at his feet\u2014are symbolic, representing loyalty or adoration, not action.\n\nSo, while the painting evokes heroism and grandeur, it does not depict actual heroic actions.\n\n**Answer: No.**"

His death was a pivotal moment in the Seven Years' War and marked the end of French rule in Canada. His death was seen as noble and self-sacrificing \u2014 he died leading his men to victory, even though he was fatally wounded.\n\n2.  **The Surrounding Figures**: The painting shows a group of men gathered around him \u2014 soldiers, officers, and even a Native American (likely a Mohawk guide, given the context of the battle). Their expressions and actions convey a sense of reverence, sorrow, and respect. They are not fleeing or ignoring him; they are attending to him, mourning his death, and honoring his sacrifice.\n\n3.  **The Symbolism**: The flag being"

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

He does not resist physically, but his posture and expression convey profound moral courage and resolve. He is not fleeing or fighting back; he is standing his ground with dignity, facing death for his principles.\n\n2.  **Moral Courage over Physical Strength:** The heroism here is not of the warrior or the conqueror, but of the intellectual and the moral individual. Socrates chooses to die rather than compromise his philosophical beliefs, which is a form of ultimate heroism in the classical and Enlightenment tradition.\n\n3.  **David\u2019s Neoclassical Ideal:** David, a leading figure of the Neoclassical movement, was inspired by ancient Greek ideals of virtue, reason, and civic duty.

It portrays **heroism defined by duty, sacrifice, and moral resolve**, rather than battlefield glory.\n\nThis is **Jacques-Louis David\u2019s *The Oath of the Horatii* (1784)**, a foundational work of Neoclassical art.\n\n---\n\n### What\u2019s Happening in the Painting:\n\nThe scene shows **three Roman brothers (the Horatii)** swearing an oath to fight to the death against three warriors from the rival city of Alba Longa \u2014 the Curiatii \u2014 to settle a dispute between the cities. Their father, standing center-right, holds up three swords as they pledge their loyalty to Rome.\n\n---\n\n### Why It\u2019s Heroic:\n\n1. **Sacrifice for the State**: The brothers are committing to die for Rome \u2014 a civic, patriotic ideal. Their heroism lies in placing the collective good above personal safety or family ties.\n\n2. **Moral Resolve**: The men are stoic, determined, and unified. Their rigid postures and outstretched arms convey unwavering commitment \u2014 a hallmark of Neoclassical heroism.\n\n3. **Contrast with Emotion**: On"

He does not resist physically, but his posture and expression convey profound moral courage and resolve. He is not fleeing or fighting back; he is standing his ground with dignity, facing death for his principles.\n\n2.  **Moral Courage over Physical Strength:** The heroism here is not of the warrior or the conqueror, but of the intellectual and the moral individual. Socrates chooses to die rather than compromise his philosophical beliefs, which is a form of ultimate heroism in the classical and Enlightenment tradition.\n\n3.  **David\u2019s Neoclassical Ideal:** David, a leading figure of the Neoclassical movement, was inspired by ancient Greek ideals of virtue, reason, and civic duty.

His death was a pivotal moment in the Seven Years' War and marked the end of French rule in Canada. His death was seen as noble and self-sacrificing \u2014 he died leading his men to victory, even though he was fatally wounded.\n\n2.  **The Surrounding Figures**: The painting shows a group of men gathered around him \u2014 soldiers, officers, and even a Native American (likely a Mohawk guide, given the context of the battle). Their expressions and actions convey a sense of reverence, sorrow, and respect. They are not fleeing or ignoring him; they are attending to him, mourning his death, and honoring his sacrifice.\n\n3.  **The Symbolism**: The flag being",

While it is a famous and iconic work, its subject matter is mythological and allegorical, not heroic in the traditional sense.\n\nHere\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t depict heroic actions:\n\n- **Subject**: The painting shows the goddess Venus (Aphrodite) emerging from the sea on a seashell, surrounded by cherubs and other figures. This is a scene from Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Venus\u2019s birth from the sea foam.\n- **Tone**: The mood is serene, sensual, and celebratory, not dramatic or action-oriented. The figures are mostly in states of contemplation, love, or admiration, not engaged in battle, sacrifice, or struggle.\n- **\u201cHeroic\u201d in Art**: In classical and academic art, \u201cheroic\u201d often refers to scenes of courage, sacrifice, or moral virtue in the face of adversity (e.g., scenes from Greek or Roman epics). This painting lacks such elements.\n\nWhile the painting is grand and dramatic in composition, its subject is mythological and romantic, not heroic. The figures are not",

He is calmly accepting his death sentence, which was a philosophical and moral stance, not a martial one.\n- **Intellectual Courage**: His \u201cheroism\u201d lies in his unwavering commitment to his principles \u2014 truth, justice, and the pursuit of wisdom \u2014 even in the face of death. He refuses to abandon his philosophical mission or compromise his beliefs.\n- **The Setting**: The dark, austere prison cell emphasizes his isolation and the gravity of his situation, highlighting the personal cost of his conviction.\n\nThis scene is a powerful depiction of philosophical heroism \u2014 a quiet, intellectual, and moral courage that transcends physical bravery. It\u2019s often interpreted as an allegory for the enduring power of reason and truth over tyranny and injustice.\n\nIn summary, while not a traditional heroic act, it is a deeply moving",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

                  "Summary": "Based on the analysis of 14 paintings, four paintings clearly depict heroic actions: 'The Oath of the Horatii' (1784 and 1785 versions), 'The Death of General Wolfe' (1770), and 'The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons' (1789).",
                  "details": "The paintings were analyzed for depictions of heroic actions, which include acts of courage, sacrifice, moral resolve, and civic duty. The following paintings were identified as depicting heroic actions:\n\n1. **The Oath of the Horatii (1784 & 1785)** by Jacques-Louis David - Depicts three Roman brothers swearing an oath to fight to the death for Rome, showing heroism through sacrifice for the state and moral resolve.\n\n2. **The Death of General Wolfe (1770)** by Benjamin West - Portrays General James Wolfe dying heroically after leading his troops to victory at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, representing heroism through sacrifice and leadership.\n\n3. **The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789)** by Jacques-Louis David - Depicts moral and civic heroism, showing the courageous act of standing up for justice and the rights of the people.\n\nOther paintings analyzed did NOT depict heroic actions, including portraits, mythological scenes of romance or intimacy, and scenes focused on emotional or philosophical moments rather than acts of valor.",
                  "source": "Information obtained through SQL database query retrieving paintings from the history painting and mythological painting genres, followed by AI-powered image analysis of each painting to determine whether it depicts heroic actions.",

                    "The Oath of the Horatii (1784)",
                    "The Oath of the Horatii (1785)",
                    "The Death of General Wolfe (1770)",
                    "The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789)"
                  ],
                  "extra explanation": "The concept of 'heroic actions' in these paintings encompasses both traditional martial heroism (battlefield courage and sacrifice) and moral/civic heroism (standing up for principles, duty to the state, and moral courage). Neoclassical paintings often emphasized these themes of virtue, sacrifice, and civic duty. Some paintings like 'The Death of Socrates' depict intellectual and moral courage but were noted as not being heroic in the 'conventional sense' of physical valor. Several paintings had incomplete analysis results (empty responses for 'The Death of Marat' versions, 'Antiochus and Stratonice', and 'The Intervention of the Sabine Women'), but based on available information, these four paintings clearly meet the criteria for depicting heroic actions."
