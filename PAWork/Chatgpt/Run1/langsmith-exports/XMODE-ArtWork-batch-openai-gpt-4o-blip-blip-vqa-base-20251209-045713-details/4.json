Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task.

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task.

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Every text2SQL action MUST include problem=<full user question>. If you omit it, the run fails.\n- Each action must have a unique, increasing idx.\n- Inputs from previous actions use $<idx> in args.\n- Plan for maximal parallelism but correctness first.\n- Use data_preparation before data_plotting; include plotting only if the user asked for a plot/visualization.\n- Use image_analysis only when visual inspection is needed (the DB has no depiction content).\n- In any text2SQL retrieval, include all relevant columns needed for downstream steps (e.g., inception for plotting/century).\n- Each sub-question is textual (no code). Keep the plan minimal if unsure\u2014do not emit empty/incomplete actions.\nAvailable actions (5 total):\n1. text2SQL(problem: str, context: Optional[Union[str,list[str]]])-->str\nThe input for this tools should be `problem` as a textual question\n - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\nIn the 'context' you could add any other information that you think is required to generate te SQL code. It can be the information from previous taks.\nThis tools is able to translate the question to the SQL code considering the database information.\nThe SQL code can be executed using sqlite3 library.\nUse the output of running generated SQL code to answer the question.\n\n2. image_analysis(question:str, context: Union[str, List[str]])-> str\n This tools is an image analysis task. For given image and a question, it analysis the image and provide answer to the question. \n The question should target only one image. For example: is there object <X> in the image? or how many <X> appears in the image? or does image depicts <Y>? It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the image.\n The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: For example. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...\n Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem.The format of the context for image_analysis should be `[{'img_path': 'xxxx'}, {'img_path': 'yyyy'}, ...]`. For example for one image: `[{'img_path': 'images/img_0.jpg'}]If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\n\n3. data_preparation (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data preparation task. For given data and question, it porcess the data and prepare the proper data structure for a request. \n - Minimize the number of `data_preparation` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n4. data_plotting (question:str, context: Union[str, List[str],dict])-> str\n This tools is a data plotting task. For given data and a question, it analysis the data and plot a proper chart to answer a user query. \n - Minimize the number of `data_plotting` actions as much as possible. if you want this tools does its job properly, you should include all required information from the user query in previous tasks.\n\n5. join(): Collects and combines results from prior actions.\njoin is always last; append <END_OF_PLAN> after join.\n",

Respond in the following format:\n    Thought: <reason about the task results and whether you have sufficient information to answer the question>\n    Action: <action to take>\n    - If an error occurs during previous actions, replan and take corrective measures to obtain the required information.\n    - Ensure that you consider errors in all the previous steps, and tries to replan accordingly.\n    - Ensure the final answer is provided in a structured format as JSON as follows:\n        {'Summary': <concise summary of the answer>,\n         'details': <detailed explanation and supporting information>,\n         'source': <source of the information or how it was obtained>,\n         'inference':<your final inference as YES, No, or list of requested information without any extra information which you can take from the `labels` as given below>,\n         'extra explanation':<put here the extra information that you dont provide in inference >,\n         }\n         In the `inferencer` do not provide additinal explanation or description. Put them in `extra explanation`.\n\n    Available actions:\n    (1) Finish(the final answer to return to the user): returns the answer and finishes the task.\n    (2) Replan(the reasoning and other information that will help you plan again. Can be a line of any length): instructs why we must replan\n\n    Using the above previous actions, decide whether to replan or finish. \n    If all the required information is present, you may finish. \n    If you have made many attempts to find the information without success, admit so and respond with whatever information you have gathered so the user can work well with you. \n    ",
