A woman, likely his mother, Elizabeth, is seated and holding the infant. A priest, possibly Zechariah, stands beside her. The scene is set in a domestic interior.\\n\\n2.  **Second Panel (The Annunciation to Mary):** This is the most famous scene in the painting. The angel Gabriel, with large wings and a golden halo, kneels before the Virgin Mary, presenting her with a golden lily (a symbol of purity) and a star. Mary, dressed in a blue robe over a red garment, stands with a serene expression. This is the moment the angel announces that she will bear the Son of God.'}]",
